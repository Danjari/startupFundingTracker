      "['Comment Back in 2019, Synex Medical founder Ben Nashman spent the night detained by US customs. Nashman tried to explain he was simply transporting materials from Buffalo to Toronto for his homemade MRI. Customs, however, took issue with the label on the package: “nuclear magnetic resonance.” Nashman spent hours in a bright waiting room before he finally convinced them that he was really just a run-of-the-mill 18-year-old scientist with an obsession with MRI technology. They let him take his roughly 80-pound magnet and he zoomed back to Toronto. “I got back at like 3 or 4 am and got a few hours of sleep before classes,” he said. Nashman, now 24, might have landed himself on a list of suspicious individuals, but he insists it was worth it: that one very long night was part of his years-long journey to build a portable MRI capable of testing glucose and other important molecules without the need to extract blood. Today, the company is one step closer to that goal, announcing a $21.8 million Series A fundraise, with investors like Accomplice, Radical Ventures, Fundomo and Khosla Ventures. It brings the company’s total haul up to over $36 million, with includes seed funding from Sam Altman. Right now, Synex’s prototype is the size of a toaster, although Nashman hopes to one day have it fit in your palm. It works by first using MRI to create a 3D image of the finger to find the best spot to test. It then uses something called magnetic resonance spectroscopy to send radio pulses that “excite the different molecules,” Nashman said. The machine then takes the signals from all the molecules and filters for a specific one. Synex will start with glucose testing, but will eventually track things like amino acids, lactate and ketones. The company introduced me to Diane Morency, a woman based in Massachusetts who has suffered from Type 2 diabetes for years. “I’ve got holes in my fingers,” she told me, adding she can no longer play her ukulele because of the pain. “It would be a godsend to not have to prick my [fingers] anymore.” But there’s a reason non-invasive glucose testing hasn’t been commercialized: it’s difficult to track glucose accurately without drawing blood, and it’s even harder to make the device portable or affordable. “We believed that was going to be an absolute moonshot,” said Jun Jeon, an investor at Khosla Ventures focusing on healthcare. Jeon has yet to try Nashman’s prototype but said that, if Nashman can deliver on his promises, then “this was a bet worth taking.” Nashman was always curious about living forever. When he was about 16, he walked into his vet’s office armed with printed-out scientific studies. He had determined that his dog should be put on the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, a drug controversially heralded by longevity enthusiasts. The vet had no idea what Nashman was talking about. “He was just like, ‘this is just way too experimental for me,’” Nashman recalled. The vet’s refusal didn’t deter him. “Later, I got my parents on it and I got on it,” he laughed. “Honestly, I think everything should be on it.” It was the first of several longevity self-experiments. Nashman briefly took diabetes drug arcarbos, forked over thousands for aPrenuvo full body scan, and, like so many in Silicon Valley before him, got his hands on acontinuous glucose monitor. His health obsession coincided with a fascination with physics — particularly the “elegant” science behind MRIs, and how much they could reveal about the human body. By 17, he had ordered materials online to make a makeshift MRI in his bedroom (it was “really crap,” he said). By 18, he had held an internship working on brain imaging at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and enrolled at the University of Toronto for engineering science. “I think I have the record for most MRIs ever, probably,” he said. “I’ve probably scanned my finger honestly 1000s of times at this point.” He realized that MRI technology could be the ultimate longevity hack, giving him more information about his body than an Oura Ring or Whoop ever could. He first sold his dreams to Altman, whom he met in 2019, and then Peter Thiel, landing the Thiel Fellowship in 2021. Nashman may have Silicon Valley’s overlords on his side, but he’s still entering a very crowded space with well-capitalized competition. Startups like Know Labs and Berlin-based DiaMonTech are both making their own non-invasive products. Applehas reportedly been quietly working ona non-invasive glucose monitor, and Google too once tried to make its own glucose monitoring contact lens beforepausing the project in 2018. Synex Medical faces an uphill battle from here. The company will have to undergo rigorous clinical trials to prove to the FDA that its machine can accurately isolate glucose molecules. There’s also the lingering question of whether Nashman can really get technology to a portable size. If not, “It wouldn’t be too useful,” Morency said. “It would do us no good outside of the house.” But let’s say Nashman nails all of that. Let’s say Synex soars through its FDA-approved trials and successfully shrinks its current metal toaster down to something that fits in your palm. It will still debut in a healthcare industry that has long struggled to make new technology affordable, according to Khosla investor Jeon. “There’s not a lot of good infrastructure and reimbursement that will allow for all patients to have access to the technology,” Jeon said. For Nashman, the chance for a longer life is worth dedicating his own life to. “I want to know exactly what my body needs. I want to know what my parents need,” he said. “A technology like this is just needed to usher in that age of predictive medicine.” Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment Apple’siOS 18 update became available to all userson September 16.

I spent the summer testing out this cargo e-bike to find out if it met that mission. My take: It’s a stylish ride that can hold plenty of cargo in many shapes and forms. But some tech issues, as well as its heaviness, might give some (including me) pause on shelling out $4,000. That said, Pedego’s five-year warranty with optional anti-theft protection might just make it all worth it. Pedego, a California-based company, has been around since 2009, so customers can benefit from a robust network of more than 200 stores throughout the country. This may be particularly valuable for e-bike newcomers who want to try before they buy or want a reliable service network — a problem that startups, like VC darlingVanMoof, faced by pursuing mainly a direct-to-consumer model with bespoke parts. Pricing is between $3,995 to $4,295, which puts it on the mid-higher end of theCargo bike price spectrum. The one I tested had a 48V 14Ah battery, which pushed the price to $4,295 (although it’s currently on sale at $4,195). However, riders can also choose the 48V 9Ah battery for a cheaper price.\\xa0Regardless of the battery size, customers may notice that it  tucks nicely into the frame of the bike, and can be removed to charge inside. The Pedego cargo e-bike has a 750W rear hub motor and 85 Nm max torque. It comes with a throttle and pedal-assist options, which is the ideal combination. I didn’t actually notice much of a difference between the pedal-assist levels, but found it easy enough to move between them. While the throttle was powerful, it often failed to take off right away if I was on a hill or had a passenger on the back. The color LCD display has enough ambient light so I could view the odometer and other information on the screen on a sunny day, and it has a handy USB-C charge port.\\xa0The handlebar has a mounted headlight with high and low beams, as well as a running light. On the back there’s a radiant taillight with an active brake light and running light. There’s a lot to love about Pedego’s Cargo e-bike, and that starts with the non-existent setup. Pedego shipped me a fully formed bike in a giant box. While breaking down all that packaging was a lesson in patience and persistence, it was preferable to setting the bike up myself. I also love the look of the Pedego Cargo bike. A little bit of wood — in the form of folding footplates and an added front basket — goes a long way towards giving an otherwise normal-looking aluminum alloy frame a vintage feel. Many people stopped me on the street to ask about the bike, with one bystander even calling it “sexy.” I rode the black model, but it also comes in white. The Pedego Cargo bike comes built with a seat in the back for an additional rider, complete with a backrest and a handlebar to hold onto. That seat can be substituted out for a number of Pedego’saccessories. You can mount up to two child seats or an extended rear rack onto which you can secure baskets, pet carriers, and insulated bags. The bike can carry 400 pounds in total, according to the company’s specs sheet. And I tested that weight limit as best I could, riding on the back while my partner and friends drove it around. And with those 20 x 4-inch fat tires, the Pedego Cargo bike also shreds nicely off-road, in case you were wondering. And it’s fast. The bike has a top speed of 28 miles per hour, which meant I was able to win a race against my partner who was riding Rad Power’sRadRunner 2. The Cargo bike also comes with a 11.5-liter water resistant storage compartment that sits just under the rider’s saddle and can be accessed from the top or the side. Two kickstand options – a single side and center double leg – make parking easy. The bike is long at 79.2 inches, which made it difficult to store and maneuver. It’s also heavy at 106 poundswithoutthe passenger or cargo kits installed. I had to lift the bike up a single step whenever I wanted to ride it, and found that exercise to be a little challenging and cumbersome. Particularly when it fell over once and I struggled to pick it back up. This bike would only really work for someone with dedicated ground-level storage, like a garage, or absolutely no low back issues. There’s no way anyone would want to lug it up even a single flight of stairs. While the bike was a very sturdy ride solo, when I put my 12-year-old nephew on the back, the handlebars got a little wobbly – which is really NOT what you want when a child you love is holding on for dear life behind you. The bike also has turn signals, but they were useless, if not a hindrance, to me. They make a horrible beeping sound when turned on, so I had to immediately stop using them out of sheer annoyance. And looking at the somewhat dim lights from the back, it’s actually not clear to other road users that you’re even using a turn signal. I would have much preferred a bell or a horn, but that was not included in the standard Pedego Cargo e-bike. The e-bike that Pedego sent me also had very squeaky brakes, and that’s not something you want to go and fix right after opening up a new bike. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Cargo bike kept turning off on me mid-ride. It was never a question of battery life, because I kept it charged. I asked Pedego about this, and they said the problem could be loose wires and recommended that I tighten them all. This could have been an anomaly, though, and with the warranty and plenty of physical stores to bring the bike to, dealing with any issues like that seem more surmountable than with other brands. Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creatorMatt Mullenwegunleashed a scathing attack on a rival firm this week, callingWP Enginea “cancer to WordPress.” Mullenweg criticized the company — which has been commercializing the open source WordPress project since 2010 — for profiteering without giving much back, while also disabling key features that make WordPress such a powerful platform in the first place. For context, WordPress powersmore than 40%of the web, and while any individual or company is free to take the open source project and run a website themselves, a number of businesses have sprung up to sell hosting services and technical expertise off the back of it. Theseinclude Automattic, which Mullenweg set up in 2005 to monetize the project he’d created two years previous; and WP Engine, a managed WordPress hosting provider that has raised nearly $300 million in funding over its 14-year history, the bulk of which came via a$250 million investment from private equity firm Silver Lakein 2018. Speaking this week atWordCamp US 2024, a WordPress-focused conference held in Portland, Oregon, Mullenweg pulled no punches in his criticism of WP Engine. Taking to the stage, Mullenweg readout a posthe had just published to his personal blog, where he points to the distinct “five for the future” investment pledges made by Automatticand WP Engine, with theformer contributing3,900 hours per week, andthe lattercontributing just 40 hours. While he acknowledged that these figures are just a “proxy,” and might not be perfectly accurate, Mullenweg said that this disparity in contributions is notable, as both Automattic and WP Engine “are roughly the same size, with revenue in the ballpark of half-a-billion [dollars].” Mullenweg has levelled criticism at at least one other big-name web host in the past, accusing GoDaddy of profiteering from the open source project without giving anything meaningful back — more specifically,he calledGoDaddy a “parasitic company” and an “existential threat to WordPress’ future”. In his latest offensive, Mullenweg didn’t stop at WP Engine, he extended his criticism to the company’s main investor. “The company [WP Engine] is controlled by Silver Lake, a private equity firm with$102 billion in assetsunder management,” Mullenweg said. “Silver Lake doesn’t give a dang about your open source ideals, it just wants return on capital. So it’s at this point that I ask everyone in the WordPress community to go vote with your wallet. Who are you giving your money to — someone who’s going to nourish the ecosystem, or someone who’s going to frack every bit of value out of it until it withers?” In response to aquestion submitted by an audience memberlater, asking for clarity on whether Mullenweg was asking WordPress users to boycott WP Engine, he said that he hoped every WP Engine customer would watch his presentation, and when it comes to the time when they’re renewing their contracts, they should think about their next steps. “There’s some really hungry other hosts —Hostinger,Bluehost Cloud,Pressable, etc, that would love to get that business,” Mullenweg said. “You might get faster performance even switching to someone else, and migrating has never been easier. That’s part of the idea of data liberation. It’s, like, one day of work to switch your site to something else, and I would highly encourage you to think about that when your contract renewal comes up, if you’re currently a customer with WP Engine.” In response to the brouhaha that followed the talk, Mullenweg published afollow up blog post, where he calls WP Engine a “cancer” to WordPress. “It’s important to remember that unchecked, cancer will spread,” he wrote. “WP Engine is setting a poor standard that others may look at and think is ok to replicate.” Mullenweg said that WP Engine is profiting off the confusion that exists between the WordPress project and the commercial services company WP Engine. “It has to be said and repeated: WP Engine is not WordPress,” Mullenweg wrote. “My own mother was confused and thought WP Engine was an official thing. Their branding, marketing, advertising, and entire promise to customers is that they’re giving you WordPress, but they’re not. And they’re profiting off of the confusion.” Mullenweg also said that WP Engine is actively selling an inferior product, because the core WordPress project stores every change that is made to allow users to revert their content to a previous version — something that WP Engine disables, as perits support page. While customers can request that revisions be enabled, support only extends to three revisions, which are automatically deleted after 60 days. WP Engine recommends that customers use a “third-party editing system” if they need extensive revision management. The reason for this, according to Mullenweg, is simple — saving money. “They disable revisions because it costs them more money to store the history of the changes in the database, and they don’t want to spend that to protect your content,” Mullenweg contends. “It strikes to the very heart of what WordPress does, and they shatter it, the integrity of your content. If you make a mistake, you have no way to get your content back, breaking the core promise of what WordPress does, which is manage and protect your content.” TechCrunch has reached out to WP Engine for comment, and will update here when we hear back.

The collaboration wasfirst reported last year, and Ive confirmed it ina New York Times profileabout what he’s been up to since leaving Apple. If the startup has a name, Ive isn’t sharing it, but it apparently emerged from dinners with Altman last year where the pair discussed the potential of generative AI. With Ive’s firm LoveFrom leading the design, the profile describes the goal as building “a product that uses A.I. to create a computing experience that is less socially disruptive than the iPhone.” So perhaps Ive and Altman can succeed where other AI device companies likeHumane have struggled. Industrial designer Marc Newson, who’s working with Ive, said the product specifics and release timing haven’t been decided.

Additional reporting: Sarah Perez Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment Linux’s luminary linchpin,Linus Torvalds, says that despite longstanding reports ofburnout in the open source software development realm, Linux is as strong as ever — though he acknowledges his project is perhaps something of an outlier due to its scale and scope. Speaking to Verizon’s head of open source Dirk Hohndel at the Linux Foundation’sOpen Source Summit Europein Vienna on Monday, Torvalds tackled a topic that has frequently reared its head inthe Linux worldandbeyond: anaging developer communityprone to burnout. “It is absolutely true that [Linux] kernel maintainers are aging, but there is a positive spin on that,” Torvalds said. “How many [open source] projects have maintainers that have literally been around for over three decades? It is very unusual. So when people say, ‘developers burn out and go away’ — yes, that’s true, but that’s kind of normal. What is not normal is that people actually stay around for decades, that’s the unusual thing, and I think that’s to some degree a good sign.” Historically, Linux was very much a C-centric kernel, but in 2022 the projectintroduced official support for Rust, a general-purpose, open-source programming languagebacked by many big-name technology companies. Just a few weeks back, Rust for Linux project lead Wedson Almeida Filhoannouncedthey were stepping down after almost four years, as they found themselves “lacking the energy and enthusiasm” to deal with some of the “non-technical nonsense” surrounding the project. Andback in January, senior Rust engineerJynn Nelsonalso noted that the burnout problem is very real. “The number of people who have left the Rust project due to burnout is shockingly high,” Nelson wrote. “The number of people in the project who are close to burnout is also shockingly high.” Linux is probably the most successful open-source project of all time, intersecting with everything from web servers and ATMs, to desktop and mobile operating systems. During these growth years, Torvalds has branched out andcreated the omnipresent version control systemknown as Git. But some 33 years onfrom Linux‘s inception, Torvalds remains the kernel’s central maintainer, with support fromtens of thousands of contributorsstemming from corporations reliant on Linux, as well as sources closer to home such as Linux Foundation fellowGreg Kroah-Kartman, who leads on the Linux kernel’s stable release. “I think part of the issue with us having a lot of developers, is that we’ve always had a lot of people who are very competent and could step up,” Torvalds said. “Greg hasn’t always been Greg — before Greg, there were Andrews and Allens, and after Greg there will be Shannons and Steves. There are people who have been around for decades, and the real issue is that you have to have a person — or a group — that people in the development community can trust. And part of trust is fundamentally about having been around for ‘long enough’ that people know how you work.” However, Torvalds acknowledged that such an ecosystem can be daunting and difficult for younger or less-experienced developers to enter, especially when they see incumbents that have been around so long. But despite that, there are newcomers who manage to make their way into the heart of the Linux project. “We have core developers that are top-level maintainers for major subsystems, who have come up in just a few years,” Torvalds said. “It’s not instant, but there are new people who come in, and three years later they are a main developer. It is not impossible at all. I think we have a fairly healthy developer subsystem, but the whole monkey dance about developers, developers, developers… we’ve got them. The fact that we also have these old, ‘graying’ people around — I don’t see that as a huge problem.” Powered byWordPress VIP', 'No content', 'No content', 'Comment Speaking Saturday at the UN Summit of the Future, Google CEO Sundar Pichai described AI as “the most transformative technology yet” and announced a new fund for AI education and training around the world.

The New York Timesreported on a new court filingin which the company’s lawyers said X had complied with the court’s orders — blocking designated accounts, paying fines, and naming a new formal representative in the country. In a filing of its own, the Supreme Court reportedly responded by telling X it had not provided the proper paperwork and giving it five days to do so. The dispute started with an investigation by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes into election misinformation. Moraes ordered the company to block certain accounts, and while X said at one point thatit would comply, it insteadshut down operations in Brazil. Moraes thenbanned the serviceand threatened users with fines if they tried to get around the ban using a VPN. X came back online in Brazil earlier this week, although Cloudflare CEOMatthew Prince told TechCrunchthat the timing of the company’s recent switch to Cloudflare infrastructure is just a “coincidence.” During the ban, Brazilian users sought out social media alternatives, leading to dramatic growth atBlueskyandTumblr. X did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment, and neither Musk nor X’s Global Government Affairs account appears to have mentioned the news.

The Wall Street Journalbroke the news late Fridaythat Qualcomm had approached Intel about a takeover.The New York Timessubsequentlycorroborated the story, while adding that no official offer has been made. Even if there is an offer, it’s not clear whether Intel would accept it or if regulators would approve. (Qualcomm did not immediately responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment; Intel declined to comment.) Once the industry leader, Intel has struggled due to a lack of mobile strategy. It reported a $1.6 billion loss in the second quarter of this year and has been implementing a $10 billion cost reduction plan that would eliminate 15,000 jobs. It’s also moving tospin out its chip foundry businessas an independent subsidiary. Intel currently has a market capitalization of around $90 billion, while Qualcomm’s is around $190 billion.

Oyo says it will pay Blackstone Real Estate $525 million in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition also includes the Studio 6 extended stay brand and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. The Indian startup opened its first U.S. location in 2019 and now operates more than 320 hotels across 35 states. Oyo is dramatically expanding its North American footprint by acquiring Motel 6 — arguably the best-known budget motel brand in the country, with a franchise network of around 1,500 locations in the United States and Canada. “This acquisition is a significant milestone for a startup company like us to strengthen our international presence,” said Oyo International CEO Gautum Swaroop in a statement. He added that Motel 6 will “continue to operate as a separate entity.” Founded in 2012, SoftBank-backed Oyo’s was valued at $10 billion in 2019, but has struggled in recent years due to pandemic-related challenges, as well ascriticism over practicessuch as offering rooms from unavailable or unlicensed hotels. Over the summer, TechCrunchreported on a new funding roundthat saw the company’s valuation fall to $2.5 billion — less than its total capital raised. (Oyo has denied reporting about its lowered valuation.) Motel 6, meanwhile, was founded in 1962. It popularized the budget motel concept (rooms originally cost $6 a night) and was eventually acquired by Blackstone for $1.9 billion in 2012. Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment A hopeful entrant in the emerging market of electric watercraft is out of action and being sold for parts. Pure Watercraft was founded in 2011 with the intention of replacing gas-based outboard motors with fully electric ones. Wecovered the company in 2016when it began taking preorders for its first commercial outboards, and in 2020 Pureraised $23 millionto step up production.GM even took a 25% stake in Pureas part of its big investment in electric infrastructure. The company offered an electric outboard and battery combo that could be mounted on a boat like any other outboard, or in a package with a rigid inflatable or pontoon boat. With prices ranging from $21,600 for just propulsion to nearly $100,000 for a full boat, Pure’s products were arguably no more affordable up front than gas options, but they were certainly a lot cleaner and quieter. But a tough market seems to have put an end to Pure’s ambitions. The company entered receivership — a sort of alternative form of bankruptcy — in July, per filing documents in King County, Washington, where it is based. In August it was also reported that a planned multi-million-dollar factory in West Virginiawould not be going forward. The documents describe numerous creditors, from individual investors to banks to the big one, GM, which put approximately $35 million into the venture. That wasn’t all cash, though: listed among Pure’s assets is some $25 million worth of “manufacturing support,” “know-how,” licensing of the name, and other forms of non-pecuniary goods. (This type of in-kind investment is fairly commonplace.) On the asset side, we find $3.6 million in “finished goods,” likely the assembled motors and battery units built by Pure, though why those would not have gone out to the more than 900 people who paid a down payment is unclear (nor is whether refunds will be issued). Another $25.5 million of “raw materials” is also listed, but what this may be is unclear — other documents detailing sale of assets like boats and batteries don’t come near that sum. TechCrunch has asked both Pure and GM for comment on the matter. GM did not offer a substantive response and we have not yet heard back from Pure. Electric watercraft is a growing but still nascent industry, with startups likeCandela,Navier,FleetZeroandZin Boatsmaking a play for cleaner, more efficient waterways and infrastructure. Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment Moksha’s meditation tool aims to kick traditional breath work exercises to the curb. As most breathing tools on the market are designed to do,Mokshaaims to help train you to breathe longer and deeper, whichstudieshave shownnaturally calm you down, relax your muscles, slow your heart rate, and stabilize your blood pressure. The smart breathing device — now available on the company’swebsiteafter launching onKickstarterlast year with over 400 preorders — is a sleek metal pendant with a mouthpiece that you can inhale and exhale through. The idea for the Gamified Meditation Tool, as the company calls it, is that by inhaling and exhaling through a small cylindrical structure, you can better control and slow your breathing. Yash Ghanekar and his co-founder Jaymin Shah came up with the idea for Moksha after dealing with some personal things that affected their mood and well-being. “My close friend had passed away, and it really triggered my anxiety to new heights. I always dealt with general anxiety and just the stress of school and social situations, but this took it to a new level, where I was having panic attacks night after night,” Ghanekar told me. Shah’s brother, a doctor, told them about the benefits of breath work, and it inspired them to collaborate with R&D experts, data scientists, mechanical engineers, and designers to build their flagship device, theBeam, a $43 necklace with a metal pendant attached to it. It also comes with afree stand-alone app. “The feedback was remarkable. We got all kinds of people reaching out to us, saying that it saved their lives. People were coming to us with all kinds of collapsed lung disease conditions, with PTSD, with anxiety, and saying that this breath work tool is really helping them,” Ghanekar said. After the success of its first device and app, the company decided to launch a smart tool that merges the two products. The most unique selling point of the Gamified Meditation Tool is that it features air pressure sensors and haptic feedback technology to help beginners learn how to breathe and meditate properly. After inhaling for 2 to 8 seconds (depending on the type of meditation exercise) andthen exhaling for 5.5 seconds, the device vibrates as a signal to begin inhaling again, eliminating the need to count in your head and helping you stay focused. This is indicated by a light buzzing feeling on your fingertips. When connected through Bluetooth, it can also track your breathing data. Notably, Moksha designed its device to resemble a vape or cigarette. The company hopes this will help redirect smokers from unhealthy habits. “Our idea is to move everything away from this oral fixation of vapes and weed pens and move it more towards mental health,” Ghanekar said. Moksha claims the device is nickel- and lead-free and doesn’t contain “chemicals or toxins that may injure your respiratory health.” The mouthpiece can be removed for easy cleaning or replaced with a new one.\\xa0Its portable charging case provides up to 60 hours of battery life. The tool’scompanion iOS appoffers breath control games, playlists, and meditation exercises to make breath work more engaging. The app offers five breath work categories that all provide different benefits: Calm, Energy, Morning, Recovery, and Sleep. Each exercise follows a similar format: a brightly colored circle expands and contracts to help you center your breathing, accompanied by calming music or nature sounds in the background. It’s the addition of the breathing tool that Moksha thinks will help people feel confident that they’re doing the breath work correctly. An enjoyable part of testing was playing the breath control game known as Copter. In this game, the player maneuvers a ball through the sky, dodging clouds by using controlled inhalation and exhalation to guide the ball up and down. While addictive, it reminded me that I should practice breath work more frequently. (Why was I so bad at something as basic as breathing?) It also reminded me of existing medical tools, such asthe incentive spirometer, which acts as exercise equipment for patients to maintain strong lungs. Similar to many traditional meditation apps, it monitors meditation sessions and maintains a daily log of users’ moods and thoughts. The smart breathing device costs $150, which may seem like a steep price for something that gets you to do a thing you do every day for free. But the price is comparable to other meditation devices:Moonbird, which you hold in your hand, costs $199; andThe Shift, another breathing device, retails for between $65 and $340, depending on the material it’s made out of. I’ve attended several breath meditation courses before in an attempt to alleviate my anxiety, but I always struggled to get into it and make it a regular habit to see real results. However, after using Moksha for nearly a month, I can say that it has made the practice a bit less boring for me. Admittedly, it’s still not a daily part of my routine, but I find myself gravitating toward it before going to stressful events or to wind down after a long week. Moksha also has a new game launching soon, so I look forward to trying that out, too. The handheld device can be used as a stand-alone product, but the app offers some free games and exercises. For $8 a month, you get access to its full library of over 500 breathing activities. Moksha’s app also features a gamified reward system that offers discounts on coffee and clothing for users for simply using the app and, well, breathing. The company teamed up with Instacart, NBA Store, and Fanatics to offer coupons. The company claims to have over $1 million in lifetime sales. To date, Moksha has raised a little under $200,000 from Republic and angel investors. Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment Eighteen months ago, Ford triggered a transformation when the U.S. automaker locked in a deal to give owners of its EVsaccess to the Tesla Supercharger network. In a stunning shift, automaker after automaker — from GM and Hyundai to Rivian and Mercedes — followed suit. By the end of 2023, nearly every major automaker had agreed to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and promised EV owners that adapters would soon be on their way. Most non-Tesla customersare still waiting. However, GM’s announcement earlier this week may provide an electric lining of optimism. EV owners of GM vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Cadillac Lyriq will nowofficially have accessto Tesla’s Superchargers. All GM EV owners need to do is purchase, and wait for, the GM-approved adapters that will allow their cars to charge on Tesla’s ports. More may soon follow. TechCrunch is tracking which brands have access to the Tesla Supercharging Network and will be updating this list. In November 2022, Tesla shared its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America. At the time, every other automaker was using the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) in North America. Mass adoption seemed unlikely at the time even though Tesla’s charging network was consideredfar superiorthanks to its robust and user-friendly design and the ease of paying for the EV juice. Six months later, Ford became the first to announce it would work with Tesla in a deal that would give its customersaccessto more than 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. But it wasn’t just about giving Ford EV owners access to a special adapter. Ford also committed to integrating its future EVs with NACS ports instead of CCS. Rivian, GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Volkwagen, Porsche, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid, and Stellantis followed. In the U.S. today, there are 36,499 NACS ports available publicly (although some of those might be fromother EV charging companiesthat have adapted Tesla’s standard), compared to around 16,925 CCS ports. That’s despitefederal dollarsthat have gone explicitly to the buildout of CCS chargers. For EV owners stuck with a CCS port, they’ll have to hold out for manufacturer-approved adapters. While there are some third-party adapters that claim to be compliant with certain safety and performance standards, likeLectron’s Vortex Plugfor $199,Tesla’s websitesays such adapters are prohibited. A GM spokesperson told TechCrunch its adapters have been specifically designed to protect GM EV batteries while charging and that its vehicle warranty doesn’t cover damage to vehicle parts resulting from the use of non-GM approved adapters. In late August, Tesla posted on X that it hadramped up productionof adapters. That statement, combined with GM’s announcement, could mean that even more non-Tesla EVs will be pulling up to Supercharger stations soon. They’ll all have to download the Tesla app so they can pay for charging. As of September 2024, GM has finally updated the software on its Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC EVs so customers can use Tesla’s Superchargers. If they want access soon, they need to purchase a “GM approved” adapter through their app for $225. GM wouldn’t say how long shipping would take. A GM spokesperson said the company already has an inventory of the adapters and that it’s worked with multiple suppliers to manufacture the approved NACS DC fast-charging adapters. From 2025 onward, GM’s EVs will be built with the NACS charge port. Certain Ford customersofficially gained accessto Tesla Superchargers in February, but ongoing supply constraints have delayed the delivery of free fast-charging adapters for most customers (although Ford says the delays have affected “some” customers). Current owners of the Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning who have yet to order their adapter can do so through their Ford Pass app. The deadline to apply for a free adapter is September 30. EV startup Rivian officially got access to 15,000 Superchargers across North America on March 18, 2024. At the time, Rivian promised to begin sending adapters to customersstarting in April. A Rivian spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker began delivery this spring and continues to ship adapters as quickly as it receives them. TechCrunch will update the list as automakers gain official access. Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment Social networks have become increasingly homogenous, showing everything from text to short videos across platforms, where algorithms often overshadow your creativity. In this ubiquitous environment, it’s harder than ever to get a genuine sense of someone’s vibe before deciding to follow them. EnterShelf, an app that lets you create a personalized “storefront” of your media habits, then connect with others based on the movies, shows, books, games, and music they consume. It also lets you track progress while reading your favorite book or watching a trending show. “If you observe culture at large on the internet, it’s shifting away from posting selfies to here’s what I’m reading, watching, screenshots of the reviews of my movies and so on. It’s essentially going deeper about a person, trying to understand what they’re in … that’s what Shelf is all about,” said Jad Esber, founder and CEO of Koodos Labs, the startup behind Shelf, in an interview. Esber grew up writing online poetry anonymously, then spent the early years of his career at YouTube in London from 2015 to 2018. During this time, he worked on the creator side of the Google subsidiary, helping people create content, grow their audience, and monetize their work. This was when YouTube grew its creator ecosystem in various emerging markets outside the U.S. After spending over three years at Google, the Cambridge University master’s graduate returned to academia, joining Harvard University to research consumer internet trends and study the internet academically. That eventually helped him conceptualize Shelf in a market full of social media apps with millions and billions of users. “We built many, many products,” Esber told TechCrunch. “They all didn’t work until Shelf, and Shelf emerged from those learnings.” The Shelf app, available on iOS and coming to Android, lets you connect your accounts associated with media, including Apple Music, Goodreads, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, then builds a customizable “storefront” web page that updates automatically based on your consumption progress. You can also manually add links to any other internet service to your virtual shelf — even links to yourfavorite TechCrunch articles, which you can showcase to your followers. The New York-based startup also plans to expand the list of supported services, including Steam for gamers. “[A]s humans and as people online, we’re very multi-hyphenate. We’re not just into music, movies, shows, and all these things. Adding support for certain categories will expand the user base, but at the same time deepens the use case for existing users,” Esber said. You can choose a URL for the digital shelf based on your preference. Likewise, the app lets you customize the interface by changing the background color and moving items depending on your taste. Koodos plans to monetize Shelf by offering new customization options. It could also explore monetizing insights that the app surfaces, Esber told TechCrunch. Unlike apps that call the data using APIs, Shelf works regardless of whether the platform has a first-party API. Generally, when users select a third-party service like Spotify or Apple Music from the Shelf UI, they’re signed in (either via a redirect to that app, or via a pop-up screen). Once the user has signed in, Esber can pull all the information about that user’s media consumption directly from the app. Esber also stated that the startup does not use the data Shelf gets from the services users list on the app to train AI, which has become a common practice among online platforms nowadays. This data-sharing is powered by a technology called DataMover, and Koodos has been working with other apps to expand this solution as well (although Esber wouldn’t say which ones). He compares DataMover with the data transfer network for fintech Plaid. “In a similar way [to Plaid], we’re affording that user provision access to data to other applications, too,” he said. Alongside letting users create their storefronts for the public, Shelf has begun testing a private experience for some users, who only want to track their own media consumption without sharing it. “We intend to be a fun utility that anyone can use over time. Everyone has a bookshelf in their living room or at home. So, why can’t everyone have the Shelf?” Esber said. Launched publicly this summer after its beta testing at the end of last year, Shelf has added half a billion items by its users. Esber declined to share user numbers but said the number of shelves on the app is growing by 40% month-to-month and that users visit Shelf an average of five times a week to check in on or update their digital shelves or keep up with others’ shelves. Koodos has raised $7 million in total from investors, including First Round Capital, M13, Blockchain Capital, and IDEO, as well as the founders of companies, including Zynga and VSCO. It also counts Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, Dubsmash co-founder (now Reddit VP) Suchit Dash, and the pioneers of market design at Harvard, Professors John Deighton and Scott Kominers as advisors. Powered byWordPress VIP', 'Comment The U.S. innovates and the EU regulates, or so certain transatlantic punters love to harp. We’re not going to get embroiled in that noise here, but two things are clear: The bloc’s Single Market has its own particular set of rules, and quite a lot of U.S. tech giants have run afoul of European Union competition regulations over the past several decades. Make of that what you will. Earlier this month, as she reveled innailing a couple of major antitrust case appeals against Apple and Google, the EU’s outgoing competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, jokingly referred to Big Tech as some of her best customers. Ouch. We’ve compiled a list of 10 of the biggest EU antitrust actions targeting tech to give a snapshot of the most high-profile — if not always consequential — competition skirmishes between Brussels and industry heavy hitters over the past several decades of digital development. The list is ordered based on the size of the fine or liability involved. While it’s fair to say the EU’s antitrust tech enforcement outcomes have varied, one lasting legacy is that some of these major cases served as inspiration for the bloc’sDigital Markets Act: A flagship market contestability reform that could see major tech players hit harder and faster in the coming years. It’s finally Big Tech’s time to buckle up. No oneenjoyspaying their taxes, even less a demand for unpaid back taxes. But by September 2018, Apple had justfinished handing the EU an eye-watering€13.1 billion(then worth $15.3 billion) after the bloc successfully sued one of its member states, Ireland, over illegal tax breaks granted to Apple between 1991 and 2014. The State Aid case, which falls broadly under the bloc’s competition rules, went back and forth through EU appeal courts. But inSeptember 2024, the Court of Justice affirmed the original August 2016\\xa0Commission finding of unlawful State Aid. With the top court weighing in with a final ruling (not a referral back to a lower court), Apple’s legal options to continue challenging the decision are all but exhausted, and the billions in underpaid taxes sitting in an EU escrow account look set to finally pour into Ireland’s coffers. Micromanaging the software that mobile device makers could bundle with its operating system, Android — to get its own wares in front of Android users regardless of the hardware they picked — got Google into costly hot water in the EU in recent years. Around $5 billion worth of antitrust heat, in fact. The2018 Commission decisionsanctioning it for abusing a dominant position was, and still is, a record-breaking penalty for this category of competition abuse. The original EU€4.34 billionfine on Google was revised down slightly, to €4.125 billion, in a September 2022appeal decision by the General Court. However, the judges largely upheld the original Commission decision, rejecting Google’s bid to overturn the enforcement. Back in June 2017,Google was hit with another(at the time) record-breaking€2.42 billionpenalty for abusing a dominant position — this one in relation to how it operated its product comparison service, Google Shopping (previously branded Google Product Search and, before that, the pun-tastic Froogle). The bloc found that Google had not only unfairly favored its own (eponymous) shopping comparison service in organic search results, a market the tech giant has almost entirely sewn up in Europe, but had also actively demoted rival comparison services. The\\xa0multi-billion-euro fine ensued — worth around $2.73 billion at the time it was announced — and was subsequently affirmed in aSeptember 2024decision by the EU’s top court. The EU branched into a competition theory of harm that accused Apple of consumer exploitation, rather than exclusionary conduct, in this long-running enforcement against Apple’s conduct in the music streaming market on iOS. The bloc’s competition division changed tack a few times, as it investigated iOS developer complaints against the App Store operator. But in March 2024 it ended uphitting Apple with a€1.84 billionfine(around $2 billion) for banning developers from telling iPhone users about cheaper deals available outside Apple’s store. The vast majority of the financial sanction — a full €1.8 billion — was applied on top of the EU’s standard damages calculation, which the bloc said it hoped would act as a deterrent. (Without it, the fine would have been a mere €40 million — or a “parking ticket” level penalty for Big Tech.) Yet another billion+ antitrust penaltyhit Google for abuse of dominancein March 2019, when the bloc sanctioned the company over its search ad brokering business. The Commission found it had used restrictive clauses in contracts with customers\\xa0between 2006 and 2016 in a bid to squeeze out rival ad brokers. A penalty of€1.49 billion(or around $1.7 billion)\\xa0was duly imposed. However, in September 2024, despite upholding the majority of the Commission’s findings, the EU’s General Courtannulled the AdSense decisionin its entirety over errors in how the Commission assessed the duration of Google’s contracts. It remains to be seen whether the EU will appeal. The Commission still has another (open) case probing Google’s adtech stack more broadly, which could also make the AdSense case look like small beer. Margrethe Vestagerwarned last yearthat if the suspected violations are confirmed, a structural separation (i.e., breaking up Google) may be the only viable remedy. In 2012, the EU handed down a total of€1.47 billionin fines ina cartels caserelated to the sale of components used in the manufacture of computer monitors and TVs. A raft of electronics giants were caught up in the enforcement over price-fixing of cathode ray tubes (CRT) between 1996 and 2006. The components were used in computer monitors and TVs in the pre-flatscreen era, and the Commission found that hardware makers had colluded to fix prices. Fines were handed down to seven electronics giants that were involved in either one or two CRT cartels, including LG, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, and Toshiba. Going further back in time, we arrive in May 2009, at what was thena record€1.06 billionantitrust penalty for chipmaker Intelafter the EU found that the U.S. giant had abused a dominant position to exclude rival AMD. Intel had been paying computer manufacturers and retailers to postpone, cancel, or otherwise avoid using or selling AMD’s products, and the EU found these exclusionary practices breached competition rules. The chipmaker appealed the EU’s enforcement with some success over the following decade of legal arguments. In 2017, the Court of Justiceset aside an earlier rulingby a lower court and referred the case back to the General Court, which went on to annul part of the Commission’s decision, while allowing that some of Intel’s practices had been unlawful. The Court quashed the original fine in its entirety, owing to uncertainty over the penalty calculation, butlast yearthe EU reimposed a fine of €376.36 million on Intel — for the “naked restrictions” that the Court had upheld. Appeals still rumble on, so where this enforcement finally ends up remains to be seen. In early 2018, it wasmobile chipmaker Qualcomm’s turnto be hit with a beefy EU antitrust penalty:€997 million(or around $1.23 billion at the time). The sanction was for abuse of a dominant position between 2011 and 2016. The enforcement focused on Qualcomm’s relationship with Apple, and the EU decided it\\xa0had shut rival chipmakers out of the market for supplying LTE baseband chipsets by paying Apple to exclusively use its chips for iPhones and iPads. However, Qualcomm appealed the decision, and in June 2022 the EU General Courtruled in its favor, rejecting the Commission’s analysis and also finding some procedural faults with its case. The EUlater confirmedit would not appeal the judgment, so this is one sizable antitrust penalty that didn’t make it beyond the headlines. The bloc has had better luck in a separate (longer-running) antitrust procedure against the chipmaker: In September 2024, the General Courtlargely upheld a Commission penaltyon Qualcomm of just under $270 million in a case related to predatory pricing. We have to wind back the clock all the way to March 2004 to arrive at the EU giving Microsoft a spanking for abusing a dominant position with its Windows operating system. The then-record€497 millionpenalty (around\\xa0$794 million) would be worth closer to €762 million (or ~$1.3 billion) today, factoring in Eurozone inflation (perthis tool). The original complaint sparking the investigation into Microsoft’s licensing and royalties practices dated all the way back to 1993. The EU’s enforcement on Microsoft wasupheld on appeal. As well as handing down a fine, the bloc ordered various remedies, including interoperability requirements, and a second, larger penalty of €899 million was handed down on Microsoft inFebruary 2008for noncompliance. A 2012 decision by the EU’s General Court upheld the noncompliance penalty but reduced the level of the noncompliance fine slightly to €860 million. In anOctober 2017 State Aid case, the EU argued that Luxembourg, the member state where e-commerce giant Amazon has its regional base, had granted the company “undue tax benefits” between May 2006 and June 2014. The Commission found that Amazon’s corporate structure in the country had allowed it to pay four times less tax than other companies based there — a tax break the EU calculated was worth around€250 million. (The EU does not issue fines for State Aid cases but requires any unlawfully uncollected taxes to be recouped.) But while the Commission took issue with Luxembourg’s method of calculating Amazon’s taxable profits in the country, unlike in the aforementioned Ireland-Apple State Aid case, its arguments did not prevail in court: In a final rulinglate last year, the EU’s top court struck down the Commission decision, finding that the EU had not established that the Luxembourg tax ruling was illegal State Aid. The upshot? Amazon was off the hook.

Per the filing, Musk didn’t notify the SEC that he wouldn’t be appearing until just three hours before his testimony was set to begin. “The Court must make clear that Musk’s gamesmanship and delay tactics must cease,” the filing reads. Musk instead spent September 10 overseeing the launch of Polaris Dawn, a spacecraft made by his space exploration company, SpaceX, according to the filing. The SEC’s legal counsel offered to reschedule Musk’s hearing to the following day, September 11. But Musk’s attorney declined, agreeing only to court dates in October. The SEC is seeking “meaningful conditional relief” if Musk doesn’t appear in court in October. The agency also signaled that it plans to file a sanctions motion against Musk to recoup its travel costs for the canceled testimony and other relief. (In the filing, the SEC said that it spent “thousands of dollars” to fly three attorneys to Los Angeles for the September 10 hearing.) Musk’s court-mandated appearancestemsfrom the SEC’s probe looking into whether the billionaire followed the law when disclosing his purchases of Twitter stock before acquiring the company for $44 billion in 2022. The probe also seeks to uncover whether Musk’s statements concerning the deal were misleading; the SEC alleges that Musk waited at least 10 days too long to disclose he was buying Twitter shares. The probe is the second time Musk has been under the SEC’s gun in recent years. In 2018, the agencyorderedMusk to step down as Tesla’s chairman and pay $40 million in penalties over tweets related to Tesla shares that the SEC found to be market-manipulating. At the time, Musk called the fraud charges an “unjustified action.” The SEC has also investigated Musk and Tesla over claims regarding Tesla vehicles’ “full self-driving” capabilities, as well as Tesla’s use of company funds to build Musk a “glass house.” You can read the full filing below. Updated 9/20 at 5:48 p.m. Pacific: We originallywrote that Musk failed to appear in a San Francisco courtroom. The courtroom was in fact in Los Angeles; we’ve made the correction and regret the error.  JOINT STATEMENT REGARDING R…bySP-TechCrunch   Powered byWordPress VIP']\n"

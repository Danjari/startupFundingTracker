## Ethical Considerations

### 1. **Respect for Intellectual Property**
   - **Attribution**: All content scraped from TechCrunch belongs to its original authors and publishers. This project provides summaries with direct links to the original content, ensuring that credit is given where due.
   - **No Misrepresentation**: The AI-generated summaries are meant to condense information for ease of understanding but must not misrepresent or distort the original content.

### 2. **Data Privacy**
   - **No User Data Collection**: This project does not collect any personal data from users. Any interaction within the app is processed locally, and no personal information is stored or transmitted.
   - **Security of API Keys**: Users are encouraged to store their API keys securely and not to share them publicly. Use `.env` files to protect sensitive information like API keys.

### 3. **Fair Use**
   - **Limitations of Scraping**: This project scrapes publicly available data from TechCrunch, a well-known news source. Users should respect the TechCrunch website's terms and conditions. The scraped content is used only for educational and non-commercial purposes.
   - **Non-Commercial Use**: The project is intended for personal, academic, or research purposes only. Commercial use of scraped data and AI-generated summaries is not permitted without prior authorization from the original content owners.

### 4. **Transparency in AI**
   - **AI Limitations**: While OpenAIâ€™s GPT model is used to enhance the summarization of content, it is important to acknowledge that the model may not always produce 100% accurate or contextually perfect results. Users should refer to the original articles for detailed and accurate information.
   - **Bias Awareness**: AI models can sometimes perpetuate biases present in the training data. The users of this app should be aware of this limitation when interpreting results and should cross-check important information against multiple sources.

### 5. **Sustainability**
   - **Efficient Resource Use**: This project uses computational resources (FAISS, OpenAI API, etc.). It is important to be mindful of the environmental impact of extended use of AI models and optimize code execution to minimize energy consumption.

## Guidelines for Users

- **Respect copyright**: Do not use this tool to redistribute or plagiarize content without permission.
- **Promote transparency**: Always include links to the original articles in any public-facing use of the tool's output.
- **Use responsibly**: This app is designed for informational purposes. Summarized content should not be used as a substitute for professional advice or in situations where accuracy is critical.

## Conclusion

This project is developed with respect for intellectual property, privacy, and ethical AI use. As a user, it is your responsibility to ensure that the tool is used in accordance with these ethical principles.

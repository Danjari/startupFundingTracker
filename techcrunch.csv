Matt Mullenweg calls WP Engine a ‘cancer to WordPress’ and urges community to switch providers,Paul Sawers,No date,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/matt-mullenweg-calls-wp-engine-a-cancer-to-wordpress-and-urges-community-to-switch-providers/,Enterprise,"Comment Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creatorMatt Mullenwegunleashed a scathing attack on a rival firm this week, callingWP Enginea “cancer to WordPress.” Mullenweg criticized the company — which has been commercializing the open source WordPress projectsince 2010— for profiteering without giving much back, while also disabling key features that make WordPress such a powerful platform in the first place. For context, WordPress powersmore than 40%of the web, and while any individual or company is free to take the open source project and run a website themselves, a number of businesses have sprung up to sell hosting services and technical expertise off the back of it. Theseinclude Automattic, which Mullenweg set up in 2005 to monetize the project he’d created two years previous; and WP Engine, a managed WordPress hosting provider that has raised nearly $300 million in funding over its 14-year history, the bulk of which came via a$250 million investment from private equity firm Silver Lakein 2018. It’s worth noting that Automattic has a history in backing WordPress hosting companies, havinginvested in WP Engineitself way back in 2011, while Mullenweg alsospoke atWP Engine’s conference just last year. Moreover, Automattic also bought a majority stake in WordPress hosting company Pressableback in 2016, as well as Gridpanein 2022. But speaking this week atWordCamp US 2024, a WordPress-focused conference held in Portland, Oregon, Mullenweg pulled no punches in his criticism of WP Engine. Taking to the stage, Mullenweg readout a posthe had just published to his personal blog, where he points to the distinct “five for the future” investment pledges made by Automatticand WP Engineto contribute resources to support the sustained growth of WordPress, with Automatticcontributing3,900 hours per week, anWP Enginecontributing just 40 hours. While he acknowledged that these figures are just a “proxy,” and might not be perfectly accurate, Mullenweg said that this disparity in contributions is notable, as both Automattic and WP Engine “are roughly the same size, with revenue in the ballpark of half-a-billion [dollars].” Mullenweg has levelled criticism at at least one other big-name web host in the past, accusing GoDaddy of profiteering from the open source project without giving anything meaningful back. More specifically,he calledGoDaddy a “parasitic company” and an “existential threat to WordPress’ future.” In his latest offensive, Mullenweg didn’t stop at WP Engine; he extended his criticism to the company’s main investor. “The company [WP Engine] is controlled by Silver Lake, a private equity firm with$102 billion in assetsunder management,” Mullenweg said. “Silver Lake doesn’t give a dang about your open source ideals, it just wants return on capital. So it’s at this point that I ask everyone in the WordPress community to go vote with your wallet. Who are you giving your money to — someone who’s going to nourish the ecosystem, or someone who’s going to frack every bit of value out of it until it withers?” In response to aquestion submitted by an audience memberlater, asking for clarity on whether Mullenweg was asking WordPress users to boycott WP Engine, he said that he hoped every WP Engine customer would watch his presentation, and when it comes to the time when they’re renewing their contracts, they should think about their next steps. “There’s some really hungry other hosts —Hostinger,Bluehost Cloud,Pressableetc, that would love to get that business,” Mullenweg said. “You might get faster performance even switching to someone else, and migrating has never been easier. That’s part of the idea of data liberation. It’s, like, one day of work to switch your site to something else, and I would highly encourage you to think about that when your contract renewal comes up, if you’re currently a customer with WP Engine.” In response to thebrouhahathatfollowed the talk, Mullenweg published afollow up blog post, where he calls WP Engine a “cancer” to WordPress. “It’s important to remember that unchecked, cancer will spread,” he wrote. “WP Engine is setting a poor standard that others may look at and think is ok to replicate.” Mullenweg said that WP Engine is profiting off the confusion that exists between the WordPress project and the commercial services company WP Engine. “It has to be said and repeated: WP Engine is not WordPress,” Mullenweg wrote. “My own mother was confused and thought WP Engine was an official thing. Their branding, marketing, advertising, and entire promise to customers is that they’re giving you WordPress, but they’re not. And they’re profiting off of the confusion.” Mullenweg also said that WP Engine is actively selling an inferior product, because the core WordPress project stores every change that is made to allow users to revert their content to a previous version — something that WP Engine disables, as perits support page. While customers can request that revisions be enabled, support only extends to three revisions, which are automatically deleted after 60 days. WP Engine recommends that customers use a “third-party editing system” if they need extensive revision management. The reason for this, according to Mullenweg, is simple — saving money. “They disable revisions because it costs them more money to store the history of the changes in the database, and they don’t want to spend that to protect your content,” Mullenweg contends. “It strikes to the very heart of what WordPress does, and they shatter it, the integrity of your content. If you make a mistake, you have no way to get your content back, breaking the core promise of what WordPress does, which is manage and protect your content.” TechCrunch has reached out to WP Engine for comment, and will update here when we hear back. This article was updated with additional context on Automattic’s previous investment in rival WordPress hosting companies, including WP Engine. Powered byWordPress VIP"

"Synex founder, once detained at the border with a 80-pound magnet, is building portable MRIs to test glucose",Margaux MacColl,No date,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/synex-founder-once-detained-at-the-border-with-a-80-pound-magnet-is-building-portable-mris-to-test-glucose/,Biotech & Health,"Comment Back in 2019, Synex Medical founder Ben Nashman spent the night detained by US customs. Nashman tried to explain he was simply transporting materials from Buffalo to Toronto for his homemade MRI. Customs, however, took issue with the label on the package: “nuclear magnetic resonance.” Nashman spent hours in a bright waiting room before he finally convinced them that he was really just a run-of-the-mill 18-year-old scientist with an obsession with MRI technology. They let him take his roughly 80-pound magnet and he zoomed back to Toronto. “I got back at like 3 or 4 am and got a few hours of sleep before classes,” he said. Nashman, now 24, might have landed himself on a list of suspicious individuals, but he insists it was worth it: that one very long night was part of his years-long journey to build a portable MRI capable of testing glucose and other important molecules without the need to extract blood. Today, the company is one step closer to that goal, announcing a $21.8 million Series A fundraise, with investors like Accomplice, Radical Ventures, Fundomo and Khosla Ventures. It brings the company’s total haul up to over $36 million, with includes seed funding from Sam Altman. Right now, Synex’s prototype is the size of a toaster, although Nashman hopes to one day have it fit in your palm. It works by first using MRI to create a 3D image of the finger to find the best spot to test. It then uses something called magnetic resonance spectroscopy to send radio pulses that “excite the different molecules,” Nashman said. The machine then takes the signals from all the molecules and filters for a specific one. Synex will start with glucose testing, but will eventually track things like amino acids, lactate and ketones. The company introduced me to Diane Morency, a woman based in Massachusetts who has suffered from Type 2 diabetes for years. “I’ve got holes in my fingers,” she told me, adding she can no longer play her ukulele because of the pain. “It would be a godsend to not have to prick my [fingers] anymore.” But there’s a reason non-invasive glucose testing hasn’t been commercialized: it’s difficult to track glucose accurately without drawing blood, and it’s even harder to make the device portable or affordable. “We believed that was going to be an absolute moonshot,” said Jun Jeon, an investor at Khosla Ventures focusing on healthcare. Jeon has yet to try Nashman’s prototype but said that, if Nashman can deliver on his promises, then “this was a bet worth taking.” Nashman was always curious about living forever. When he was about 16, he walked into his vet’s office armed with printed-out scientific studies. He had determined that his dog should be put on the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, a drug controversially heralded by longevity enthusiasts. The vet had no idea what Nashman was talking about. “He was just like, ‘this is just way too experimental for me,’” Nashman recalled. The vet’s refusal didn’t deter him. “Later, I got my parents on it and I got on it,” he laughed. “Honestly, I think everything should be on it.” It was the first of several longevity self-experiments. Nashman briefly took diabetes drug arcarbos, forked over thousands for aPrenuvo full body scan, and, like so many in Silicon Valley before him, got his hands on acontinuous glucose monitor. His health obsession coincided with a fascination with physics — particularly the “elegant” science behind MRIs, and how much they could reveal about the human body. By 17, he had ordered materials online to make a makeshift MRI in his bedroom (it was “really crap,” he said). By 18, he had held an internship working on brain imaging at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and enrolled at the University of Toronto for engineering science. “I think I have the record for most MRIs ever, probably,” he said. “I’ve probably scanned my finger honestly 1000s of times at this point.” He realized that MRI technology could be the ultimate longevity hack, giving him more information about his body than an Oura Ring or Whoop ever could. He first sold his dreams to Altman, whom he met in 2019, and then Peter Thiel, landing the Thiel Fellowship in 2021. Nashman may have Silicon Valley’s overlords on his side, but he’s still entering a very crowded space with well-capitalized competition. Startups like Know Labs and Berlin-based DiaMonTech are both making their own non-invasive products. Applehas reportedly been quietly working ona non-invasive glucose monitor, and Google too once tried to make its own glucose monitoring contact lens beforepausing the project in 2018. Synex Medical faces an uphill battle from here. The company will have to undergo rigorous clinical trials to prove to the FDA that its machine can accurately isolate glucose molecules. There’s also the lingering question of whether Nashman can really get technology to a portable size. If not, “It wouldn’t be too useful,” Morency said. “It would do us no good outside of the house.” But let’s say Nashman nails all of that. Let’s say Synex soars through its FDA-approved trials and successfully shrinks its current metal toaster down to something that fits in your palm. It will still debut in a healthcare industry that has long struggled to make new technology affordable, according to Khosla investor Jeon. “There’s not a lot of good infrastructure and reimbursement that will allow for all patients to have access to the technology,” Jeon said. For Nashman, the chance for a longer life is worth dedicating his own life to. “I want to know exactly what my body needs. I want to know what my parents need,” he said. “A technology like this is just needed to usher in that age of predictive medicine.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Some startups are going ‘fair source’ to avoid the pitfalls of open source licensing,Paul Sawers,No date,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/some-startups-are-going-fair-source-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-open-source-licensing/,No category,"Comment With theperennial tensionsbetween proprietary and open source software (OSS) unlikely to end anytime soon, a$3 billion startupis throwing its weight behind a new licensing paradigm — one that’s designed to bridge the open and proprietary worlds, replete with new definition, terminology, and governance model. Developersoftware company Sentryrecentlyintroduceda new license category dubbed “fair source.” Sentry is an initial adopter, as are some half dozen others, includingGitButler, a developer tooling company from one of GitHub’s founders Thefair source conceptis designed to help companies align themselves with the “open” software development sphere, without encroaching into existing licensing landscapes, be thatopen source,open core, orsource-available, and while avoiding any negative associations that exist with “proprietary.” However, fair source is also a response to the growing sense that open source isn’t working out commercially. “Open source isn’t a business model — open source is a distribution model, it’s a software development model, primarily,”Chad Whitacre, Sentry’s head of open source, told TechCrunch. “And in fact, it places severe limits on what business models are available, because of the licensing terms.” Sure, there are hugely successful open source projects, but they are generally components of larger proprietary products. Businesses that have flown the open source flag have mostly retreated to protect their hard work, moving either from fully permissive to a more restrictive “copyleft” license, as the likes ofElement did last yearandGrafana before it, or ditched open source altogether asHashiCorp did with Terraform. “Most of the world’s software is still closed source,” Whitacre added. “Kubernetes is open source, but Google Search is closed. React is open source, but Facebook Newsfeed is closed. With fair source, we’re carving a space for companies to safely share not just these lower-level infrastructure components, but share access to their core product.” Sentry, anapp performance monitoring platformthat helps companies such as Microsoft and Disney detect and diagnose buggy software, was initially available under a permissiveBSD 3-Clause open source license. But in 2019, the producttransitionedto a business source license (BUSL), a more restrictive source-available license initiallycreated by MariaDB. This move was to counter what co-founder and CTO David Cramer called “funded businesses plagiarizing or copying our work to directly compete with Sentry.” Fast forward to last August, and Sentryannouncedthat it was making arecently acquireddeveloper tool calledCodecov“open source.” This wasto the chagrin of many, who questioned whether the company could really call it “open source” given that it was being released under BUSL — a license that isn’t compatible with the Open Source Initiative’s (OSI)definitionof “open source.” Cramer swiftlyissuedan apology of sorts, explaining that while it had erroneously used the descriptor, the BUSL license adheres to the spirit of what many open source licenses are about: Users can self-host and modify the code without paying the creator a dime. They just can’t commercialize the product as a competing service. But BUSL isn’t open source. “We sort of stuck our foot in it, stirred the hornet’s next,” Whitacre said. “But it was during the debate that followed where we realized that we need a new term. Because we’re not proprietary, and clearly, the community does not accept that we’re open source. And we’re not open core, either.” Those who follow the open source world know that terminology is everything, and Sentry is far from the first company to fall in its (mis)use of the established nomenclature. Nonetheless, the episode sparkedAdam Jacob, CEO and co-founder ofDevOps startup System Initiative, tochallengesomeone to develop a brand and manifesto to cover the type of licenses that Sentry wanted to align itself with — similar to what the OSI has been doing for the past quarter century with open source, but with a more commercially attractive gradient. And that was what led Sentry to fair source. For now, the main recommended fair source license is the Functional Source License (FSL), whichSentry itself launched last yearas a simpler alternative to BUSL. However, BUSL itself has also now been designated fair source, as has another new Sentry-created license called the Fair Core License (FCL), both of which are included to support the needs of different projects. Companies are welcome to submit their own license for consideration, though all fair source licenses should have three core stipulations: It [the code] should be publicly available to read; allow third parties to use, modify, and redistribute with “minimal restrictions“; and have a delayed open source publication (DOSP) stipulation, meaning it converts to a true open source license after a predefined period of time. With Sentry’s FSL license, that period is two years; for BUSL, the default period is four years. The concept of “delaying” publication of source code under a true open source license is a key defining element of a fair source license, separating it from other models such as open core. The DOSP protects a company’s commercial interests in the short term, before the code becomes fully open source. However, a definition that uses vague subjectives such as “minimal restrictions” can surely cause problems. What is meant by that, exactly, and what kinds of restrictions are acceptable? “We just launched this a month ago — this is a long play,” Whitacre said. “Open source [the OSI definition] has been around for 25-plus years. So some of this is open for conversation; we want to see what emerges and pin it down over time.” The flagship fair source license follows a similar path to that of “source available” licenses before it, insofar as it hasnoncompete stipulationsthat prohibit commercial use in competing products. This includes any product that offers “the same or substantially similar functionality” as the original software. And this is one of the core problems of such licenses, according toThierry Carrez, general manager at theOpen Infrastructure Foundationand board member at the Open Source Initiative: Much is open to interpretation and can be “legally fuzzy.” “Fair source licenses are not open source licenses because the freedoms they grant do not apply to everyone; they discriminate based on legally fuzzy noncompete rules,” Carrez said. “So, widespread adoption of those licenses would not only create legal uncertainty, it would also significantly reduce innovation going forward.” Moreover, Carrez added that there is nothing preventing the terms in fair source licenses from changing in the future, highlighting the problem of a license controlled by a single entity. “There are two approaches to software development: You can have a proprietary approach, with a single entity producing the software and monetizing it; or you can have a commons approach, where an open ecosystem gathers around producing software and sharing the benefits of it,” Carrez said. “In the proprietary approach, nothing prevents the single copyright-holder from changing the terms of the deal going forward. So the exact terms of the license they happen to currently use do not matter as much as the trust you put in those companies to not change them.” In many ways, fair source is simply an exercise in branding — one that allows companies to cherry-pick parts of an established open source ethos that they cherish, while getting to avoid calling themselves “proprietary” or some other variant. Amanda Brock, CEO of U.K. open source advocacy bodyOpenUK, said that while it’s “great to see people simply being honest that [their software] is not open source,” shesuggestedthat this new category of license might just complicate matters — particularly as there are already well-established names for this kind of software. “We must shift thinking to consider three categories of software not two; OpenUK has been advocating for some time that we do this,” Brock told TechCrunch. “Within open source, we call the category that is proprietary with source that is public, as ‘source available’ or ‘public source.’ It is any code that makes [the] source [code] available, and which is distributed on a license that does not meet the open source definition.” Scott Chacon, who lays claim to being one of GitHub’s four founders and served as its chief information officer before his departure in 2016, launched a new Git-focused startup called GitButler at the start of 2023. He went through a whole gamut of licensing considerations, including fully proprietary, before settling on FSL andpublicly proclaiminghis support of the fair source movement. “We are still somewhat unsure what our final business model will be and want to retain our options,” Chacon told TechCrunch. “We know that if a company releases under an OSS license and then needs to relicense under something more restrictive in order to make their business work, there is an understandable outcry from the community.” And that gets to the crux of the issue for many businesses today. Sure, everyone loves open source, but with all the backpedaling, startups today are hesitant to go all in and then risk the ire of the global community by having to change course. “We liked the fact that it [BUSL / FSL-style license] is eventually open source, under an MIT license, but it gives us some air cover while we’re investing so heavily in it,” Chacon said. “We want to be able to protect our employees and our investors while giving our users as much access and freedom as possible.” GitHub is actually a good jumping-off point for discussing the fair source movement. TheMicrosoft-ownedcode-hosting platform is central to open source software, andGitHub has open-sourcedseveral ofits own internal toolsthrough the years. However, GitHub itself isn’t open source. Former GitHub CEO Tom Preston-Wernerwrote about this very matterback in 2011, waxing lyrical about the virtues of open source while describing things that should be kept back. “Don’t open source anything that represents core business value,” he wrote. And it’s this approach that Chacon is taking into his latest venture. “My philosophy is to open source everything that you don’t mind, or even prefer, for your competitors to use,” he said. “I think that if fair source was a thing 15 years ago, we may have made the GitHub source public then under a license like that.” Other businesses to join the early fair source fervor include YC-alumCodeCrafters;PowerSync;Ptah.sh; andKeygen, whose founderZeke Gabrielseis actually partnering with Whitacre to handle governance around new fair source applications. “Our governance at this point is scaled to the size of the initiative, so it’s myself and Zeke, our decision-making is public on GitHub, and anybody’s free to jump in,” Whitacre said, adding that there could be scope to set up independent oversight in the future — though it’s not a priority right now. “We’re really just planting the seed, and seeing where it goes,” Whitacre said. “It’s a long play, so we’ll evolve the structure along the movement.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
The TechCrunch Cyber Glossary,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,No date,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/,Security,"Comment Cybersecurity is a world full of technical lingo and jargon. At TechCrunch, we have beenwriting about cybersecurity for years, and even we sometimes need a refresher on what exactly a specific word or expression means. That’s why we have created this glossary, which includes some of the most common — and not so common — words and expressions that we use in our articles, and explanations of how — and why — we use them. This is a developing compendium, and we will update it regularly. The ability to run commands or malicious code on an affected system, often because of a security vulnerability in the system’s software. Arbitrary code execution can be achieved either remotely or with physical access to an affected system (such as someone’s device). In the cases where arbitrary code execution can be achieved over the internet, security researchers typically call this remote code execution. Often, code execution is used as a way to plant a backdoor for maintaining long-term and persistent access to that system, or for running malware that can be used to access deeper parts of the system or other devices on the same network. (Also see:Remote code execution) Botnets are networks of hijacked internet-connected devices, such as webcams and home routers, that have been compromised by malware (or sometimes weak or default passwords) for the purposes of being used in cyberattacks. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of devices, and are typically controlled by a command-and-control server that sends out commands to ensnared devices. Botnets can be used for a range of malicious reasons, like using the distributed network of devices to mask andshield the internet traffic of cybercriminals,deliver malware, or harnessing their collective bandwidth to maliciously crash websites and online services with huge amounts of junk internet traffic. (See:Command-and-control server;Distributed denial-of-service) A bug is essentially the cause of a software glitch, such as an error or a problem that causes the software to crash or behave in an unexpected way. In some cases, a bug can also be a security vulnerability. The term “bug” originated in 1947, at a time early computers were the size of rooms and made up of heavy mechanical and moving equipment. The first known incident of a bug found in a computer was when a mothdisrupted the electronicsof one of these room-sized computers. (Also see:Vulnerability) Command-and-control servers (also known as C2 servers) are used by cybercriminals to remotely manage and control their fleets of compromised devices and launch cyberattacks, such as delivering malware over the internet and launching distributed denial-of-service attacks. (See also:Botnet;Distributed denial-of-service) When we talk about data breaches, we ultimately mean the improper removal of data from where it should have been. Butthe circumstances matterand can alter the terminology we use to describe a particular incident. A data breach is when protected data was confirmed to have improperly left a system from where it was originally stored, and usually confirmed when someone discovers the compromised data. More often than not, we’re referring to the exfiltration of data by a malicious cyberattacker, or otherwise detected as a result of an inadvertent exposure. Depending on what is known about the incident, we may describe it in more specific terms where details are known. (Also see:Data exposure;Data leak) A data exposure (a type of data breach) is when protected data is stored on a system that has no access controls, such as because of human error or a misconfiguration. This might include cases where a system or database is connected to the internet but without a password. Just because data was exposed doesn’t mean the data was actively discovered, but nevertheless could still be considered a data breach. A data leak (a type of data breach) is where protected data is stored on a system in a way that it was allowed to escape, such as due to a previously unknown vulnerability in the system or by way of insider access (such as an employee). A data leak can mean that data could have been exfiltrated or otherwise collected, but there may not always be the technical means, such as logs, to know for sure. Orchestrating a distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, is akind of cyberattackthat involves flooding targets on the internet with junk web traffic in order to overload and crash the servers, and cause the service, such as a website, online store or gaming platform. DDoS attacks are launched by botnets, which are made up of networks of hacked internet-connected devices (such as home routers and webcams) that can be remotely controlled by a malicious operator, usually from a command-and-control server. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of hijacked devices. While a DDoS is a form of cyberattack, these data-flooding attacks are not “hacks” in themselves as they don’t involve the breach and exfiltration of data from their targets, but instead cause a “denial of service” event to the affected service. (Also see:Botnet;Command-and-control server) Most modern systems are protected with multiple layers of security, including the ability to set user accounts with more restricted access to the underlying system’s configurations and settings. This prevents these users — or anyone with improper access to one of these user accounts — from tampering with the core underlying system. However, an “escalation of privileges” event can involve exploiting a bug or tricking the system into granting the user more access rights than they should have. Malware can also take advantage of bugs or flaws caused by escalation of privileges by gaining deeper access to a device or a connected network, potentially allowing the malware to spread. An exploit is the way and means in which a vulnerability is abused or taken advantage of, usually in order to break into a system. (Also see:Bug;Vulnerability) Short for “information security,” an alternative term used to describe defensive cybersecurity focused on the protection of data and information. “Infosec” may be the preferred term for industry veterans, while the term “cybersecurity” has become widely accepted. In modern times, the two terms have become largely interchangeable. Jailbreaking is used in several contexts to mean the use of exploits and other hacking techniques to circumvent the security of a device, or removing the restrictions a manufacturer puts on hardware or software. In the context of iPhones, for example, a jailbreak isa technique to remove Apple’s restrictionson installing apps outside of its so-called “walled garden,” or to gain the ability toconduct security research on Apple devices, which is normally highly restricted. In the context of AI, jailbreaking means figuring out a way to get a chatbot togive out information that it’s not supposed to. Malware is a broad, umbrella term that describes malicious software. Malware can land in many forms and be used to exploit systems in different ways. As such, malware that is used for specific purposes can often be referred to as its own sub-category. For example, the type of malware used for conducting surveillance on people’s devices is also called “spyware,” while malware that encrypts files and demands money from its victims also goes by “ransomware.” (Also see:Spyware) Metadata is informationaboutsomething digital, rather than its contents. That can include details about the size of a file or document, who created it, and when, or in the case of digital photos, where the image was taken and information about the device that took the photo. Metadata may not identify the contents of a file, but can be useful in determining the sourcing of where a document came from or who authored it. Metadata can also refer to information about an exchange, such as who made a call or sent a text message, but not the contents of the call or the message themselves. Remote code execution refers to the ability to run commands or malicious code (such as malware) on a system from over a network, often the internet, without requiring any human interaction. Remote code execution attacks can range in complexity, but can be highly damaging vulnerabilities when exploited. (Also see:Arbitrary code execution) A broad term, like malware, that covers a range of surveillance monitoring software. Spyware is typically used to refer to malware made by private companies, such as NSO Group’s Pegasus, Intellexa’s Predator, and Hacking Team’s Remote Control System, among others, which the companies sell to government agencies. In more generic terms, these types of malware are like remote access tools, which allows their operators — usually government agents — to spy and monitor their targets, giving them the ability to access a device’s camera and microphone, or exfiltrate data. Spyware is also referred to as commercial or government spyware, or mercenary spyware. (Also see:Stalkerware) Stalkerware is a kind of surveillance malware (and a form of spyware) that is usually sold to ordinary consumers under the guise of child or employee monitoring software but is often used for the purposes of spying on the phones of unwitting individuals, oftentimes spouses and domestic partners. The spyware grants access to the target’s messages, location, and more. Stalkerware typically requires physical access to a target’s device, which gives the attacker the ability to install it directly on the target’s device, often because the attacker knows the target’s passcode. (See:Spyware) What are you trying to protect? Who are you worried about that could go after you or your data? How could these attackers get to the data? The answers to these kinds of questions are what will lead you to create a threat model. In other words, threat modeling is a process that an organization or an individual has to go through to design software that is secure, and devise techniques to secure it. A threat model can be focused and specific depending on the situation. A human rights activist in an authoritarian country has a different set of adversaries, and data to protect, than a large corporation in a democratic country that is worried about ransomware, for example. When we describe “unauthorized” access, we’re referring to the accessing of a computer system by breaking any of its security features, such as a login prompt, a password, which would be considered illegal under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or the CFAA. TheSupreme Court in 2021clarified the CFAA, finding that accessing a system lacking any means of authorization — for example, a database with no password — is not illegal, as you cannot break a security feature that isn’t there. It’s worth noting that “unauthorized” is a broadly used term and often used by companies subjectively, and as such has been used to describe malicious hackers who steal someone’s password to break in through to incidents of insider access or abuse by employees. A vulnerability (also referred to as a security flaw) is a type of bug that causes software to crash or behave in an unexpected way that affects the security of the system or its data. Sometimes, two or more vulnerabilities can be used in conjunction with each other — known as “vulnerability chaining” — to gain deeper access to a targeted system. (Also see:Bug;Exploit) A zero-day is a specific type of security vulnerability that has already been publicly disclosed or exploited, but that the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software has been given no time (or “zero days”) to fix the problem. As such, there may be no immediate fix or mitigation to prevent an affected system from being compromised. This can be particularly problematic for internet-connected devices.

SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son has been planning his comeback,Anthony Ha,2024-09-22T14:19:07-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/softbanks-masayoshi-son-has-been-planning-his-comeback/,Venture,"Comment Anew Financial Times profileof Mayayoshi Son opens with SoftBank CEO seeming to hit bottom, staring at his “ugly” face on Zoom and telling himself, “I have done nothing I can be proud of.” The scene is presented as the prelude to a hoped-for a comeback, with Son largely disappearing from the public eye after SoftBank’s Vision Fundtook huge lossesfrom investments like WeWork. Lionel Barber, who’s written a new biography of Son called “Gambling Man,” said that while Son appeared to be “doing penance,” he was actually “plotting a comeback.” Now SoftBank isbetting big on AI, finding success bytaking chip design company Arm public— though even with AI, Son admits “maybe we were a little too early.” Beyond the details of Son’s investment strategy and track record, there are some fun personal details, like his apparent fascination with Napoleon. When an activist investor brought up Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg in a 2020 meeting with Son, he reportedly dismissed them as “one-business guys.” “The right comparison for me is Napoleon, Genghis Khan or Emperor Qin,” Son said. “I am not a CEO. I am building an empire.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Matt Mullenweg calls WP Engine a ‘cancer to WordPress’ and urges community to switch providers,Paul Sawers,2024-09-22T11:15:04-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/matt-mullenweg-calls-wp-engine-a-cancer-to-wordpress-and-urges-community-to-switch-providers/,Enterprise,"Comment Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creatorMatt Mullenwegunleashed a scathing attack on a rival firm this week, callingWP Enginea “cancer to WordPress.” Mullenweg criticized the company — which has been commercializing the open source WordPress projectsince 2010— for profiteering without giving much back, while also disabling key features that make WordPress such a powerful platform in the first place. For context, WordPress powersmore than 40%of the web, and while any individual or company is free to take the open source project and run a website themselves, a number of businesses have sprung up to sell hosting services and technical expertise off the back of it. Theseinclude Automattic, which Mullenweg set up in 2005 to monetize the project he’d created two years previous; and WP Engine, a managed WordPress hosting provider that has raised nearly $300 million in funding over its 14-year history, the bulk of which came via a$250 million investment from private equity firm Silver Lakein 2018. It’s worth noting that Automattic has a history in backing WordPress hosting companies, havinginvested in WP Engineitself way back in 2011, while Mullenweg alsospoke atWP Engine’s conference just last year. Moreover, Automattic also bought a majority stake in WordPress hosting company Pressableback in 2016, as well as Gridpanein 2022. But speaking this week atWordCamp US 2024, a WordPress-focused conference held in Portland, Oregon, Mullenweg pulled no punches in his criticism of WP Engine. Taking to the stage, Mullenweg readout a posthe had just published to his personal blog, where he points to the distinct “five for the future” investment pledges made by Automatticand WP Engineto contribute resources to support the sustained growth of WordPress, with Automatticcontributing3,900 hours per week, anWP Enginecontributing just 40 hours. While he acknowledged that these figures are just a “proxy,” and might not be perfectly accurate, Mullenweg said that this disparity in contributions is notable, as both Automattic and WP Engine “are roughly the same size, with revenue in the ballpark of half-a-billion [dollars].” Mullenweg has levelled criticism at at least one other big-name web host in the past, accusing GoDaddy of profiteering from the open source project without giving anything meaningful back. More specifically,he calledGoDaddy a “parasitic company” and an “existential threat to WordPress’ future.” In his latest offensive, Mullenweg didn’t stop at WP Engine; he extended his criticism to the company’s main investor. “The company [WP Engine] is controlled by Silver Lake, a private equity firm with$102 billion in assetsunder management,” Mullenweg said. “Silver Lake doesn’t give a dang about your open source ideals, it just wants return on capital. So it’s at this point that I ask everyone in the WordPress community to go vote with your wallet. Who are you giving your money to — someone who’s going to nourish the ecosystem, or someone who’s going to frack every bit of value out of it until it withers?” In response to aquestion submitted by an audience memberlater, asking for clarity on whether Mullenweg was asking WordPress users to boycott WP Engine, he said that he hoped every WP Engine customer would watch his presentation, and when it comes to the time when they’re renewing their contracts, they should think about their next steps. “There’s some really hungry other hosts —Hostinger,Bluehost Cloud,Pressableetc, that would love to get that business,” Mullenweg said. “You might get faster performance even switching to someone else, and migrating has never been easier. That’s part of the idea of data liberation. It’s, like, one day of work to switch your site to something else, and I would highly encourage you to think about that when your contract renewal comes up, if you’re currently a customer with WP Engine.” In response to thebrouhahathatfollowed the talk, Mullenweg published afollow up blog post, where he calls WP Engine a “cancer” to WordPress. “It’s important to remember that unchecked, cancer will spread,” he wrote. “WP Engine is setting a poor standard that others may look at and think is ok to replicate.” Mullenweg said that WP Engine is profiting off the confusion that exists between the WordPress project and the commercial services company WP Engine. “It has to be said and repeated: WP Engine is not WordPress,” Mullenweg wrote. “My own mother was confused and thought WP Engine was an official thing. Their branding, marketing, advertising, and entire promise to customers is that they’re giving you WordPress, but they’re not. And they’re profiting off of the confusion.” Mullenweg also said that WP Engine is actively selling an inferior product, because the core WordPress project stores every change that is made to allow users to revert their content to a previous version — something that WP Engine disables, as perits support page. While customers can request that revisions be enabled, support only extends to three revisions, which are automatically deleted after 60 days. WP Engine recommends that customers use a “third-party editing system” if they need extensive revision management. The reason for this, according to Mullenweg, is simple — saving money. “They disable revisions because it costs them more money to store the history of the changes in the database, and they don’t want to spend that to protect your content,” Mullenweg contends. “It strikes to the very heart of what WordPress does, and they shatter it, the integrity of your content. If you make a mistake, you have no way to get your content back, breaking the core promise of what WordPress does, which is manage and protect your content.” TechCrunch has reached out to WP Engine for comment, and will update here when we hear back. This article was updated with additional context on Automattic’s previous investment in rival WordPress hosting companies, including WP Engine. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Synex founder, once detained at the border with a 80-pound magnet, is building portable MRIs to test glucose",Margaux MacColl,2024-09-22T10:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/synex-founder-once-detained-at-the-border-with-a-80-pound-magnet-is-building-portable-mris-to-test-glucose/,Biotech & Health,"Comment Back in 2019,Synex Medicalfounder Ben Nashman spent the night detained by US customs. Nashman tried to explain he was simply transporting materials from Buffalo to Toronto for his homemade MRI. Customs, however, took issue with the label on the package: “nuclear magnetic resonance.” Nashman spent hours in a bright waiting room before he finally convinced them that he was really just a run-of-the-mill 18-year-old scientist with an obsession with MRI technology. They let him take his roughly 80-pound magnet, and he zoomed back to Toronto. “I got back at like 3 or 4 am and got a few hours of sleep before classes,” he said. Nashman, now 24, might have landed himself on a list of suspicious individuals, but he insists it was worth it: that one very long night was part of his years-long journey to build a portable MRI capable of testing glucose and other important molecules without the need to extract blood. Today, the company is one step closer to that goal, announcing a $21.8 million Series A fundraise, with investors like Accomplice, Radical Ventures, Fundomo and Khosla Ventures. It brings the company’s total haul up to over $36 million, with includes seed funding from Sam Altman. Right now, Synex’s prototype is the size of a toaster, although Nashman hopes to one day have it fit in your palm. It works by first using MRI to create a 3D image of the finger to find the best spot to test. It then uses something called magnetic resonance spectroscopy to send radio pulses that “excite the different molecules,” Nashman said. The machine then takes the signals from all the molecules and filters for a specific one. Synex will start with glucose testing, but will eventually track things like amino acids, lactate and ketones. The company introduced me to Diane Morency, a woman based in Massachusetts who has suffered from Type 2 diabetes for years. “I’ve got holes in my fingers,” she told me, adding she can no longer play her ukulele because of the pain. “It would be a godsend to not have to prick my [fingers] anymore.” But there’s a reason non-invasive glucose testing hasn’t been commercialized: it’s difficult to track glucose accurately without drawing blood, and it’s even harder to make the device portable or affordable. “We believed that was going to be an absolute moonshot,” said Jun Jeon, an investor at Khosla Ventures focusing on healthcare. Jeon has yet to try Nashman’s prototype but said that, if Nashman can deliver on his promises, then “this was a bet worth taking.” Nashman was always curious about living forever. When he was about 16, he walked into his vet’s office armed with printed-out scientific studies. He had determined that his dog should be put on the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, a drug controversially heralded by longevity enthusiasts. The vet had no idea what Nashman was talking about. “He was just like, ‘this is just way too experimental for me,’” Nashman recalled. The vet’s refusal didn’t deter him. “Later, I got my parents on it and I got on it,” he laughed. “Honestly, I think everything should be on it.” It was the first of several longevity self-experiments. Nashman briefly took the diabetes drug arcarbos, forked over thousands for aPrenuvo full body scan, and, like so many in Silicon Valley before him, got his hands on acontinuous glucose monitor. His health obsession coincided with a fascination with physics — particularly the “elegant” science behind MRIs, and how much they could reveal about the human body. By 17, he had ordered materials online to make a makeshift MRI in his bedroom (it was “really crap,” he said). By 18, he had held an internship working on brain imaging at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and enrolled at the University of Toronto for engineering science. “I think I have the record for most MRIs ever, probably,” he said. “I’ve probably scanned my finger honestly 1000s of times at this point.” He realized that MRI technology could be the ultimate longevity hack, giving him more information about his body than an Oura Ring or Whoop ever could. He first sold his dreams to Altman, whom he met in 2019, and then Peter Thiel, landing the Thiel Fellowship in 2021. Nashman may have Silicon Valley’s overlords on his side, but he’s still entering a very crowded space with well-capitalized competition. Startups like Know Labs and Berlin-based DiaMonTech are both making their own non-invasive products. Applehas reportedly been quietly working ona non-invasive glucose monitor, and Google too once tried to make its own glucose monitoring contact lens beforepausing the project in 2018. Synex Medical faces an uphill battle from here. The company will have to undergo rigorous clinical trials to prove to the FDA that its machine can accurately isolate glucose molecules. There’s also the lingering question of whether Nashman can really get technology to a portable size. If not, “It wouldn’t be too useful,” Morency said. “It would do us no good outside of the house.” But let’s say Nashman nails all of that. Let’s say Synex soars through its FDA-approved trials and successfully shrinks its current metal toaster down to something that fits in your palm. It will still debut in a healthcare industry that has long struggled to make new technology affordable, according to Khosla investor Jeon. “There’s not a lot of good infrastructure and reimbursement that will allow for all patients to have access to the technology,” Jeon said. For Nashman, the chance for a longer life is worth dedicating his own life to. “I want to know exactly what my body needs. I want to know what my parents need,” he said. “A technology like this is just needed to usher in that age of predictive medicine.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Yup, Jony Ive is working on an AI device startup with OpenAI",Anthony Ha,2024-09-22T09:32:22-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/yup-jony-ive-is-working-on-a-new-ai-device-company-with-openai/,AI,"Comment Jony Ive, the legendary designer wholeft his full-time role at Applefive years ago, is working on a new startup with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman. The collaboration wasfirst reported last year, and Ive confirmed it ina New York Times profileabout what he’s been up to since leaving Apple. If the startup has a name, Ive isn’t sharing it, but it emerged from dinners with Altman last year. With Ive’s firm LoveFrom leading the design, the profile describes the goal as building “a product that uses A.I. to create a computing experience that is less socially disruptive than the iPhone.” Industrial designer Marc Newson, who’s working with Ive, said the product specifics and release timing haven’t been decided. Despite that vagueness, the startup is fundraising, with Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective and Ive himself contributing. It sounds like the company is aiming to raise up to $1 billion by the end of the year. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Pedego’s Cargo e-bike: Sporty, stylish and powerful for $4,000",Rebecca Bellan,2024-09-22T09:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/pedegos-cargo-e-bike-sporty-stylish-and-powerful-for-4000/,Transportation,"Comment ThePedego’s Cargo e-bikeis marketed as a powerful and sporty ride that’s geared towards parents toting kids around town and anyone who needs to schlep heavy gear. I spent the summer testing out this cargo e-bike to find out if it met that mission. My take: It’s a stylish ride that can hold plenty of cargo in many shapes and forms. But some tech issues, as well as its heaviness, might give some (including me) pause on shelling out $4,000. That said, Pedego’s five-year warranty with optional anti-theft protection might just make it all worth it. Pedego, a California-based company, has been around since 2009, so customers can benefit from a robust network of more than 200 stores throughout the country. This may be particularly valuable for e-bike newcomers who want to try before they buy or want a reliable service network — a problem that startups, like VC darlingVanMoof, faced by pursuing mainly a direct-to-consumer model with bespoke parts. Pricing is between $3,995 to $4,295, which puts it on the mid-higher end of theCargo bike price spectrum. The one I tested had a 48V 14Ah battery, which pushed the price to $4,295 (although it’s currently on sale at $4,195). However, riders can also choose the 48V 9Ah battery for a cheaper price. Regardless of the battery size, customers may notice that it  tucks nicely into the frame of the bike, and can be removed to charge inside. The Pedego cargo e-bike has a 750W rear hub motor and 85 Nm max torque. It comes with a throttle and pedal-assist options, which is the ideal combination. I didn’t actually notice much of a difference between the pedal-assist levels, but found it easy enough to move between them. While the throttle was powerful, it often failed to take off right away if I was on a hill or had a passenger on the back. The color LCD display has enough ambient light so I could view the odometer and other information on the screen on a sunny day, and it has a handy USB-C charge port. The handlebar has a mounted headlight with high and low beams, as well as a running light. On the back there’s a radiant taillight with an active brake light and running light. There’s a lot to love about Pedego’s Cargo e-bike, and that starts with the non-existent setup. Pedego shipped me a fully formed bike in a giant box. While breaking down all that packaging was a lesson in patience and persistence, it was preferable to setting the bike up myself. I also love the look of the Pedego Cargo bike. A little bit of wood — in the form of folding footplates and an added front basket — goes a long way towards giving an otherwise normal-looking aluminum alloy frame a vintage feel. Many people stopped me on the street to ask about the bike, with one bystander even calling it “sexy.” I rode the black model, but it also comes in white. The Pedego Cargo bike comes built with a seat in the back for an additional rider, complete with a backrest and a handlebar to hold onto. That seat can be substituted out for a number of Pedego’saccessories. You can mount up to two child seats or an extended rear rack onto which you can secure baskets, pet carriers, and insulated bags. The bike can carry 400 pounds in total, according to the company’s specs sheet. And I tested that weight limit as best I could, riding on the back while my partner and friends drove it around. And with those 20 x 4-inch fat tires, the Pedego Cargo bike also shreds nicely off-road, in case you were wondering. And it’s fast. The bike has a top speed of 28 miles per hour, which meant I was able to win a race against my partner who was riding Rad Power’sRadRunner 2. The Cargo bike also comes with a 11.5-liter water resistant storage compartment that sits just under the rider’s saddle and can be accessed from the top or the side. Two kickstand options – a single side and center double leg – make parking easy. The bike is long at 79.2 inches, which made it difficult to store and maneuver. It’s also heavy at 106 poundswithoutthe passenger or cargo kits installed. I had to lift the bike up a single step whenever I wanted to ride it, and found that exercise to be a little challenging and cumbersome. Particularly when it fell over once and I struggled to pick it back up. This bike would only really work for someone with dedicated ground-level storage, like a garage, or absolutely no low back issues. There’s no way anyone would want to lug it up even a single flight of stairs. While the bike was a very sturdy ride solo, when I put my 12-year-old nephew on the back, the handlebars got a little wobbly – which is really NOT what you want when a child you love is holding on for dear life behind you. The bike also has turn signals, but they were useless, if not a hindrance, to me. They make a horrible beeping sound when turned on, so I had to immediately stop using them out of sheer annoyance. And looking at the somewhat dim lights from the back, it’s actually not clear to other road users that you’re even using a turn signal. I would have much preferred a bell or a horn, but that was not included in the standard Pedego Cargo e-bike. The e-bike that Pedego sent me also had very squeaky brakes, and that’s not something you want to go and fix right after opening up a new bike. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Cargo bike kept turning off on me mid-ride. It was never a question of battery life, because I kept it charged. I asked Pedego about this, and they said the problem could be loose wires and recommended that I tighten them all. This could have been an anomaly, though, and with the warranty and plenty of physical stores to bring the bike to, dealing with any issues like that seem more surmountable than with other brands.

Ibotta’s CEO explains why startups shouldn’t try to time the IPO market,Rebecca Szkutak,2024-09-22T08:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/ibottas-ceo-explains-why-startups-shouldnt-try-to-time-the-ipo-market/,Startups,"Comment The IPO market has not roared back in 2024as many investors hoped it would — not yet, at least. Elevated interest rates (this week’s 50 bps rate cut notwithstanding) and uncertainty related to the U.S. election have prompted many companies to stay private andwait for better market conditions. But a handful of companies did go public this spring. Enterprise rewards platform Ibotta, which builds the backend rewards program infrastructure for enterprise clients like Walmart and Exxon, was one of them, debuting on the NYSE on April 18. ItsIPO priced above its initial price rangeat $88 a share and debuted at $117 a share. It’s currently trading at $63 a share with a $1.7 billion market cap. Ibotta’s CEO, Bryan Leach, told TechCrunch that five months after the IPO, he doesn’t regret taking his company public this year. Going public requires months of planning, and he thinks companies trying to time the market are making a “huge mistake.” “Who knows what the [Federal Reserve] will do?” Leach said. “[Bankers say] it’s always better to wait, but you never know what will happen when you wait. At the end of the day, it’s not a destination, it’s a phase.” Numerous companies that were expected to go public in 2022 or 2023 are still waiting on the sidelines. Many of these companies are sitting on large valuations that they gained from funding rounds during the boom days of 2021 and they would have to suffer a haircut to go public. There were 310 IPOs in the U.S. in 2021, according to PitchBook data. This has dropped sharply since. There were 80 in 2022, 85 in 2023 and 37 through the first half of 2024. Leach admitted that some people consider the fact that Ibotta’s stock has dropped nearly 50% since its IPO as a sign that going public at this time wasn’t the right decision, or they might say that the company should have waited. Still, he feels it is too early to draw such conclusions, pointing to how Instacart’s stock is now trading close to its debut price — it hit a52-week high today— a year after its IPO. “Things are going great,” Leach said. “We are the largest tech IPO in Colorado history. The stock has gone way up, and gone down, and that sort of settles in over the course of the year. From a company perspective, we’ve been pleasantly surprised by how much value we got out of being a public company.” Public companies also have an air of legitimacy around them, and Leach said that leverage is useful when it comes to nabbing potential enterprise customers. He said the company’s recent deal with Instacart may not have happened if Ibotta were still private. “They trust us,” Leach said. “We have a certain amount of legitimacy. They know we have the resources. They can look at our finances. They can see we don’t have any debt. There is a level of comfort that [being a public company] provides.” He added that the same level of legitimacy applies to hiring, too. Ibotta is no longer offering stock options tied to a private valuation given by investors with no downside protection, and Leach said that makes the company a more attractive option for talent. Leach said companies on the fence about doing an IPO shouldn’t try to time the market, but they should wait until they are ready to be a public company. Going public this April was not the company’s first choice, either. During the SPAC and IPO craze of 2020 and 2021, Ibotta’s investors began asking it to go public, and so the company hired bankers and wrote up an S-1, an SEC document that kicks off the IPO process. It was ready to set out on an IPO roadshow in fall of 2021 but decided to hold off. Ibotta had landed a large deal with Walmart to run a white-label version of its rewards program at the time, Leach said, but he wanted to be able to prove the deal was actually working before going public. Not everyone was pleased with the company’s decision to wait. Still, Leach feels it was the right choice. Waiting until 2024 allowed Ibotta to go public with six quarters of profitability behind it and get its finances in order. Other late-stage companies in the same boat, he thinks, shouldn’t wait around for a “better” market. Investors don’t seem to mind companies waiting it out — at least they aren’t expressing otherwise publicly. But the IPO market is bound to open again eventually. Interest rates have started to go down and there is an increase in rumors surrounding companies hiring bankers to start the IPO process. Companies may be done waiting come 2025.

Linus Torvalds explains why aging Linux developers are a good thing,Paul Sawers,2024-09-22T06:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/linus-torvalds-explains-why-aging-linux-developers-are-a-good-thing/,No category,"Comment Linux’s luminary linchpin,Linus Torvalds, says that despite longstanding reports ofburnout in the open source software development realm, Linux is as strong as ever — though he acknowledges his project is perhaps something of an outlier due to its scale and scope. Speaking to Verizon’s head of open source Dirk Hohndel at the Linux Foundation’sOpen Source Summit Europein Vienna on Monday, Torvalds tackled a topic that has frequently reared its head inthe Linux worldandbeyond: anaging developer communityprone to burnout. “It is absolutely true that [Linux] kernel maintainers are aging, but there is a positive spin on that,” Torvalds said. “How many [open source] projects have maintainers that have literally been around for over three decades? It is very unusual. So when people say, ‘developers burn out and go away’ — yes, that’s true, but that’s kind of normal. What is not normal is that people actually stay around for decades, that’s the unusual thing, and I think that’s to some degree a good sign.” Historically, Linux was very much a C-centric kernel, but in 2022 the projectintroduced official support for Rust, a general-purpose, open-source programming languagebacked by many big-name technology companies. Just a few weeks back, Rust for Linux project lead Wedson Almeida Filhoannouncedthey were stepping down after almost four years, as they found themselves “lacking the energy and enthusiasm” to deal with some of the “non-technical nonsense” surrounding the project. Andback in January, senior Rust engineerJynn Nelsonalso noted that the burnout problem is very real. “The number of people who have left the Rust project due to burnout is shockingly high,” Nelson wrote. “The number of people in the project who are close to burnout is also shockingly high.” Linux is probably the most successful open-source project of all time, intersecting with everything from web servers and ATMs, to desktop and mobile operating systems. During these growth years, Torvalds has branched out andcreated the omnipresent version control systemknown as Git. But some 33 years onfrom Linux‘s inception, Torvalds remains the kernel’s central maintainer, with support fromtens of thousands of contributorsstemming from corporations reliant on Linux, as well as sources closer to home such as Linux Foundation fellowGreg Kroah-Kartman, who leads on the Linux kernel’s stable release. “I think part of the issue with us having a lot of developers, is that we’ve always had a lot of people who are very competent and could step up,” Torvalds said. “Greg hasn’t always been Greg — before Greg, there were Andrews and Allens, and after Greg there will be Shannons and Steves. There are people who have been around for decades, and the real issue is that you have to have a person — or a group — that people in the development community can trust. And part of trust is fundamentally about having been around for ‘long enough’ that people know how you work.” However, Torvalds acknowledged that such an ecosystem can be daunting and difficult for younger or less-experienced developers to enter, especially when they see incumbents that have been around so long. But despite that, there are newcomers who manage to make their way into the heart of the Linux project. “We have core developers that are top-level maintainers for major subsystems, who have come up in just a few years,” Torvalds said. “It’s not instant, but there are new people who come in, and three years later they are a main developer. It is not impossible at all. I think we have a fairly healthy developer subsystem, but the whole monkey dance about developers, developers, developers… we’ve got them. The fact that we also have these old, ‘graying’ people around — I don’t see that as a huge problem.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
The TechCrunch Cyber Glossary,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-09-22T05:30:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/,Security,"Comment Cybersecurity is a world full of technical lingo and jargon. At TechCrunch, we have beenwriting about cybersecurity for years, and even we sometimes need a refresher on what exactly a specific word or expression means. That’s why we have created this glossary, which includes some of the most common — and not so common — words and expressions that we use in our articles, and explanations of how — and why — we use them. This is a developing compendium, and we will update it regularly. The ability to run commands or malicious code on an affected system, often because of a security vulnerability in the system’s software. Arbitrary code execution can be achieved either remotely or with physical access to an affected system (such as someone’s device). In the cases where arbitrary code execution can be achieved over the internet, security researchers typically call this remote code execution. Often, code execution is used as a way to plant a backdoor for maintaining long-term and persistent access to that system, or for running malware that can be used to access deeper parts of the system or other devices on the same network. (Also see:Remote code execution) Botnets are networks of hijacked internet-connected devices, such as webcams and home routers, that have been compromised by malware (or sometimes weak or default passwords) for the purposes of being used in cyberattacks. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of devices, and are typically controlled by a command-and-control server that sends out commands to ensnared devices. Botnets can be used for a range of malicious reasons, like using the distributed network of devices to mask andshield the internet traffic of cybercriminals,deliver malware, or harnessing their collective bandwidth to maliciously crash websites and online services with huge amounts of junk internet traffic. (See:Command-and-control server;Distributed denial-of-service) A bug is essentially the cause of a software glitch, such as an error or a problem that causes the software to crash or behave in an unexpected way. In some cases, a bug can also be a security vulnerability. The term “bug” originated in 1947, at a time early computers were the size of rooms and made up of heavy mechanical and moving equipment. The first known incident of a bug found in a computer was when a mothdisrupted the electronicsof one of these room-sized computers. (Also see:Vulnerability) Command-and-control servers (also known as C2 servers) are used by cybercriminals to remotely manage and control their fleets of compromised devices and launch cyberattacks, such as delivering malware over the internet and launching distributed denial-of-service attacks. (See also:Botnet;Distributed denial-of-service) When we talk about data breaches, we ultimately mean the improper removal of data from where it should have been. Butthe circumstances matterand can alter the terminology we use to describe a particular incident. A data breach is when protected data was confirmed to have improperly left a system from where it was originally stored, and usually confirmed when someone discovers the compromised data. More often than not, we’re referring to the exfiltration of data by a malicious cyberattacker, or otherwise detected as a result of an inadvertent exposure. Depending on what is known about the incident, we may describe it in more specific terms where details are known. (Also see:Data exposure;Data leak) A data exposure (a type of data breach) is when protected data is stored on a system that has no access controls, such as because of human error or a misconfiguration. This might include cases where a system or database is connected to the internet but without a password. Just because data was exposed doesn’t mean the data was actively discovered, but nevertheless could still be considered a data breach. A data leak (a type of data breach) is where protected data is stored on a system in a way that it was allowed to escape, such as due to a previously unknown vulnerability in the system or by way of insider access (such as an employee). A data leak can mean that data could have been exfiltrated or otherwise collected, but there may not always be the technical means, such as logs, to know for sure. Orchestrating a distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, is akind of cyberattackthat involves flooding targets on the internet with junk web traffic in order to overload and crash the servers, and cause the service, such as a website, online store or gaming platform. DDoS attacks are launched by botnets, which are made up of networks of hacked internet-connected devices (such as home routers and webcams) that can be remotely controlled by a malicious operator, usually from a command-and-control server. Botnets can be made up of hundreds or thousands of hijacked devices. While a DDoS is a form of cyberattack, these data-flooding attacks are not “hacks” in themselves as they don’t involve the breach and exfiltration of data from their targets, but instead cause a “denial of service” event to the affected service. (Also see:Botnet;Command-and-control server) Most modern systems are protected with multiple layers of security, including the ability to set user accounts with more restricted access to the underlying system’s configurations and settings. This prevents these users — or anyone with improper access to one of these user accounts — from tampering with the core underlying system. However, an “escalation of privileges” event can involve exploiting a bug or tricking the system into granting the user more access rights than they should have. Malware can also take advantage of bugs or flaws caused by escalation of privileges by gaining deeper access to a device or a connected network, potentially allowing the malware to spread. An exploit is the way and means in which a vulnerability is abused or taken advantage of, usually in order to break into a system. (Also see:Bug;Vulnerability) Short for “information security,” an alternative term used to describe defensive cybersecurity focused on the protection of data and information. “Infosec” may be the preferred term for industry veterans, while the term “cybersecurity” has become widely accepted. In modern times, the two terms have become largely interchangeable. Jailbreaking is used in several contexts to mean the use of exploits and other hacking techniques to circumvent the security of a device, or removing the restrictions a manufacturer puts on hardware or software. In the context of iPhones, for example, a jailbreak isa technique to remove Apple’s restrictionson installing apps outside of its so-called “walled garden,” or to gain the ability toconduct security research on Apple devices, which is normally highly restricted. In the context of AI, jailbreaking means figuring out a way to get a chatbot togive out information that it’s not supposed to. Malware is a broad, umbrella term that describes malicious software. Malware can land in many forms and be used to exploit systems in different ways. As such, malware that is used for specific purposes can often be referred to as its own sub-category. For example, the type of malware used for conducting surveillance on people’s devices is also called “spyware,” while malware that encrypts files and demands money from its victims also goes by “ransomware.” (Also see:Spyware) Metadata is informationaboutsomething digital, rather than its contents. That can include details about the size of a file or document, who created it, and when, or in the case of digital photos, where the image was taken and information about the device that took the photo. Metadata may not identify the contents of a file, but can be useful in determining the sourcing of where a document came from or who authored it. Metadata can also refer to information about an exchange, such as who made a call or sent a text message, but not the contents of the call or the message themselves. Remote code execution refers to the ability to run commands or malicious code (such as malware) on a system from over a network, often the internet, without requiring any human interaction. Remote code execution attacks can range in complexity, but can be highly damaging vulnerabilities when exploited. (Also see:Arbitrary code execution) A broad term, like malware, that covers a range of surveillance monitoring software. Spyware is typically used to refer to malware made by private companies, such as NSO Group’s Pegasus, Intellexa’s Predator, and Hacking Team’s Remote Control System, among others, which the companies sell to government agencies. In more generic terms, these types of malware are like remote access tools, which allows their operators — usually government agents — to spy and monitor their targets, giving them the ability to access a device’s camera and microphone, or exfiltrate data. Spyware is also referred to as commercial or government spyware, or mercenary spyware. (Also see:Stalkerware) Stalkerware is a kind of surveillance malware (and a form of spyware) that is usually sold to ordinary consumers under the guise of child or employee monitoring software but is often used for the purposes of spying on the phones of unwitting individuals, oftentimes spouses and domestic partners. The spyware grants access to the target’s messages, location, and more. Stalkerware typically requires physical access to a target’s device, which gives the attacker the ability to install it directly on the target’s device, often because the attacker knows the target’s passcode. (See:Spyware) What are you trying to protect? Who are you worried about that could go after you or your data? How could these attackers get to the data? The answers to these kinds of questions are what will lead you to create a threat model. In other words, threat modeling is a process that an organization or an individual has to go through to design software that is secure, and devise techniques to secure it. A threat model can be focused and specific depending on the situation. A human rights activist in an authoritarian country has a different set of adversaries, and data to protect, than a large corporation in a democratic country that is worried about ransomware, for example. When we describe “unauthorized” access, we’re referring to the accessing of a computer system by breaking any of its security features, such as a login prompt, a password, which would be considered illegal under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or the CFAA. TheSupreme Court in 2021clarified the CFAA, finding that accessing a system lacking any means of authorization — for example, a database with no password — is not illegal, as you cannot break a security feature that isn’t there. It’s worth noting that “unauthorized” is a broadly used term and often used by companies subjectively, and as such has been used to describe malicious hackers who steal someone’s password to break in through to incidents of insider access or abuse by employees. A vulnerability (also referred to as a security flaw) is a type of bug that causes software to crash or behave in an unexpected way that affects the security of the system or its data. Sometimes, two or more vulnerabilities can be used in conjunction with each other — known as “vulnerability chaining” — to gain deeper access to a targeted system. (Also see:Bug;Exploit) A zero-day is a specific type of security vulnerability that has already been publicly disclosed or exploited, but that the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software has been given no time (or “zero days”) to fix the problem. As such, there may be no immediate fix or mitigation to prevent an affected system from being compromised. This can be particularly problematic for internet-connected devices.

Some startups are going ‘fair source’ to avoid the pitfalls of open source licensing,Paul Sawers,2024-09-22T05:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/some-startups-are-going-fair-source-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-open-source-licensing/,No category,"Comment With theperennial tensionsbetween proprietary and open source software (OSS) unlikely to end anytime soon, a$3 billion startupis throwing its weight behind a new licensing paradigm — one that’s designed to bridge the open and proprietary worlds, replete with new definition, terminology, and governance model. Developersoftware company Sentryrecentlyintroduceda new license category dubbed “fair source.” Sentry is an initial adopter, as are some half dozen others, includingGitButler, a developer tooling company from one of GitHub’s founders Thefair source conceptis designed to help companies align themselves with the “open” software development sphere, without encroaching into existing licensing landscapes, be thatopen source,open core, orsource-available, and while avoiding any negative associations that exist with “proprietary.” However, fair source is also a response to the growing sense that open source isn’t working out commercially. “Open source isn’t a business model — open source is a distribution model, it’s a software development model, primarily,”Chad Whitacre, Sentry’s head of open source, told TechCrunch. “And in fact, it places severe limits on what business models are available, because of the licensing terms.” Sure, there are hugely successful open source projects, but they are generally components of larger proprietary products. Businesses that have flown the open source flag have mostly retreated to protect their hard work, moving either from fully permissive to a more restrictive “copyleft” license, as the likes ofElement did last yearandGrafana before it, or ditched open source altogether asHashiCorp did with Terraform. “Most of the world’s software is still closed source,” Whitacre added. “Kubernetes is open source, but Google Search is closed. React is open source, but Facebook Newsfeed is closed. With fair source, we’re carving a space for companies to safely share not just these lower-level infrastructure components, but share access to their core product.” Sentry, anapp performance monitoring platformthat helps companies such as Microsoft and Disney detect and diagnose buggy software, was initially available under a permissiveBSD 3-Clause open source license. But in 2019, the producttransitionedto a business source license (BUSL), a more restrictive source-available license initiallycreated by MariaDB. This move was to counter what co-founder and CTO David Cramer called “funded businesses plagiarizing or copying our work to directly compete with Sentry.” Fast forward to last August, and Sentryannouncedthat it was making arecently acquireddeveloper tool calledCodecov“open source.” This wasto the chagrin of many, who questioned whether the company could really call it “open source” given that it was being released under BUSL — a license that isn’t compatible with the Open Source Initiative’s (OSI)definitionof “open source.” Cramer swiftlyissuedan apology of sorts, explaining that while it had erroneously used the descriptor, the BUSL license adheres to the spirit of what many open source licenses are about: Users can self-host and modify the code without paying the creator a dime. They just can’t commercialize the product as a competing service. But BUSL isn’t open source. “We sort of stuck our foot in it, stirred the hornet’s next,” Whitacre said. “But it was during the debate that followed where we realized that we need a new term. Because we’re not proprietary, and clearly, the community does not accept that we’re open source. And we’re not open core, either.” Those who follow the open source world know that terminology is everything, and Sentry is far from the first company to fall in its (mis)use of the established nomenclature. Nonetheless, the episode sparkedAdam Jacob, CEO and co-founder ofDevOps startup System Initiative, tochallengesomeone to develop a brand and manifesto to cover the type of licenses that Sentry wanted to align itself with — similar to what the OSI has been doing for the past quarter century with open source, but with a more commercially attractive gradient. And that was what led Sentry to fair source. For now, the main recommended fair source license is the Functional Source License (FSL), whichSentry itself launched last yearas a simpler alternative to BUSL. However, BUSL itself has also now been designated fair source, as has another new Sentry-created license called the Fair Core License (FCL), both of which are included to support the needs of different projects. Companies are welcome to submit their own license for consideration, though all fair source licenses should have three core stipulations: It [the code] should be publicly available to read; allow third parties to use, modify, and redistribute with “minimal restrictions“; and have a delayed open source publication (DOSP) stipulation, meaning it converts to a true open source license after a predefined period of time. With Sentry’s FSL license, that period is two years; for BUSL, the default period is four years. The concept of “delaying” publication of source code under a true open source license is a key defining element of a fair source license, separating it from other models such as open core. The DOSP protects a company’s commercial interests in the short term, before the code becomes fully open source. However, a definition that uses vague subjectives such as “minimal restrictions” can surely cause problems. What is meant by that, exactly, and what kinds of restrictions are acceptable? “We just launched this a month ago — this is a long play,” Whitacre said. “Open source [the OSI definition] has been around for 25-plus years. So some of this is open for conversation; we want to see what emerges and pin it down over time.” The flagship fair source license follows a similar path to that of “source available” licenses before it, insofar as it hasnoncompete stipulationsthat prohibit commercial use in competing products. This includes any product that offers “the same or substantially similar functionality” as the original software. And this is one of the core problems of such licenses, according toThierry Carrez, general manager at theOpen Infrastructure Foundationand board member at the Open Source Initiative: Much is open to interpretation and can be “legally fuzzy.” “Fair source licenses are not open source licenses because the freedoms they grant do not apply to everyone; they discriminate based on legally fuzzy noncompete rules,” Carrez said. “So, widespread adoption of those licenses would not only create legal uncertainty, it would also significantly reduce innovation going forward.” Moreover, Carrez added that there is nothing preventing the terms in fair source licenses from changing in the future, highlighting the problem of a license controlled by a single entity. “There are two approaches to software development: You can have a proprietary approach, with a single entity producing the software and monetizing it; or you can have a commons approach, where an open ecosystem gathers around producing software and sharing the benefits of it,” Carrez said. “In the proprietary approach, nothing prevents the single copyright-holder from changing the terms of the deal going forward. So the exact terms of the license they happen to currently use do not matter as much as the trust you put in those companies to not change them.” In many ways, fair source is simply an exercise in branding — one that allows companies to cherry-pick parts of an established open source ethos that they cherish, while getting to avoid calling themselves “proprietary” or some other variant. Amanda Brock, CEO of U.K. open source advocacy bodyOpenUK, said that while it’s “great to see people simply being honest that [their software] is not open source,” shesuggestedthat this new category of license might just complicate matters — particularly as there are already well-established names for this kind of software. “We must shift thinking to consider three categories of software not two; OpenUK has been advocating for some time that we do this,” Brock told TechCrunch. “Within open source, we call the category that is proprietary with source that is public, as ‘source available’ or ‘public source.’ It is any code that makes [the] source [code] available, and which is distributed on a license that does not meet the open source definition.” Scott Chacon, who lays claim to being one of GitHub’s four founders and served as its chief information officer before his departure in 2016, launched a new Git-focused startup called GitButler at the start of 2023. He went through a whole gamut of licensing considerations, including fully proprietary, before settling on FSL andpublicly proclaiminghis support of the fair source movement. “We are still somewhat unsure what our final business model will be and want to retain our options,” Chacon told TechCrunch. “We know that if a company releases under an OSS license and then needs to relicense under something more restrictive in order to make their business work, there is an understandable outcry from the community.” And that gets to the crux of the issue for many businesses today. Sure, everyone loves open source, but with all the backpedaling, startups today are hesitant to go all in and then risk the ire of the global community by having to change course. “We liked the fact that it [BUSL / FSL-style license] is eventually open source, under an MIT license, but it gives us some air cover while we’re investing so heavily in it,” Chacon said. “We want to be able to protect our employees and our investors while giving our users as much access and freedom as possible.” GitHub is actually a good jumping-off point for discussing the fair source movement. TheMicrosoft-ownedcode-hosting platform is central to open source software, andGitHub has open-sourcedseveral ofits own internal toolsthrough the years. However, GitHub itself isn’t open source. Former GitHub CEO Tom Preston-Wernerwrote about this very matterback in 2011, waxing lyrical about the virtues of open source while describing things that should be kept back. “Don’t open source anything that represents core business value,” he wrote. And it’s this approach that Chacon is taking into his latest venture. “My philosophy is to open source everything that you don’t mind, or even prefer, for your competitors to use,” he said. “I think that if fair source was a thing 15 years ago, we may have made the GitHub source public then under a license like that.” Other businesses to join the early fair source fervor include YC-alumCodeCrafters;PowerSync;Ptah.sh; andKeygen, whose founderZeke Gabrielseis actually partnering with Whitacre to handle governance around new fair source applications. “Our governance at this point is scaled to the size of the initiative, so it’s myself and Zeke, our decision-making is public on GitHub, and anybody’s free to jump in,” Whitacre said, adding that there could be scope to set up independent oversight in the future — though it’s not a priority right now. “We’re really just planting the seed, and seeing where it goes,” Whitacre said. “It’s a long play, so we’ll evolve the structure along the movement.” Powered byWordPress VIP"

X reverses course in Brazil,Anthony Ha,2024-09-21T11:41:19-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/21/x-reverses-course-in-brazil/,Social,"Comment It seems that Elon Musk-owned social network X (formerly Twitter) is backing down from a confrontation with Brazil’s Supreme Court. The New York Timesreported on a new court filingin which the company’s lawyers said X had complied with the court’s orders — blocking designated accounts, paying fines, and naming a new formal representative in the country. In a filing of its own, the Supreme Court reportedly responded by telling X it had not provided the proper paperwork and giving it five days to do so. The dispute started with an investigation by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes into election misinformation. Moraes ordered the company to block certain accounts, and while X said at one point thatit would comply, it insteadshut down operations in Brazil. Moraes thenbanned the serviceand threatened users with fines if they tried to get around the ban using a VPN. X came back online in Brazil earlier this week, although Cloudflare CEOMatthew Prince told TechCrunchthat the timing of the company’s recent switch to Cloudflare infrastructure is just a “coincidence.” During the ban, Brazilian users sought out social media alternatives, leading to dramatic growth atBlueskyandTumblr. X did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment, and neither Musk nor X’s Global Government Affairs account appears to have mentioned the news. (Both accounts have criticized Moraes’ decisions in the past.) On Wednesday, Xsaidit would “continue efforts to work with the Brazilian government to return very soon for the people of Brazil.” Powered byWordPress VIP"

India’s Oyo acquires Motel 6 for $525M,Anthony Ha,2024-09-21T08:55:08-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/21/indias-oyo-acquires-motel-6-for-525m/,Startups,"Comment One of India’s largest startups, budget hotel company Oyo, hasreached a dealto acquire G6 Hospitality, which operates Motel 6. Oyo says it will pay Blackstone Real Estate $525 million in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition also includes the Studio 6 extended stay brand and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. The Indian startup opened its first U.S. location in 2019 and now operates more than 320 hotels across 35 states. Oyo is dramatically expanding its North American footprint by acquiring Motel 6 — arguably the best-known budget motel brand in the country, with a franchise network of around 1,500 locations in the United States and Canada. “This acquisition is a significant milestone for a startup company like us to strengthen our international presence,” said Oyo International CEO Gautum Swaroop in a statement. He added that Motel 6 will “continue to operate as a separate entity.” Founded in 2012, SoftBank-backed Oyo’s was valued at $10 billion in 2019, but has struggled in recent years due to pandemic-related challenges, as well ascriticism over practicessuch as offering rooms from unavailable or unlicensed hotels. Over the summer, TechCrunchreported on a new funding roundthat saw the company’s valuation fall to $2.5 billion — less than its total capital raised. (Oyo has denied reporting about its lowered valuation.) Motel 6, meanwhile, was founded in 1962. It popularized the budget motel concept (rooms originally cost $6 a night) and was eventually acquired by Blackstone for $1.9 billion in 2012. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Electric outboard startup Pure Watercraft is selling itself for parts,Devin Coldewey,2024-09-21T08:47:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/21/electric-outboard-startup-pure-watercraft-is-selling-itself-for-parts/,Climate,"Comment A hopeful entrant in the emerging market of electric watercraft is out of action and being sold for parts. Pure Watercraft was founded in 2011 with the intention of replacing gas-based outboard motors with fully electric ones. Wecovered the company in 2016when it began taking preorders for its first commercial outboards, and in 2020 Pureraised $23 millionto step up production.GM even took a 25% stake in Pureas part of its big investment in electric infrastructure. The company offered an electric outboard and battery combo that could be mounted on a boat like any other outboard, or in a package with a rigid inflatable or pontoon boat. With prices ranging from $21,600 for just propulsion to nearly $100,000 for a full boat, Pure’s products were arguably no more affordable up front than gas options, but they were certainly a lot cleaner and quieter. But a tough market seems to have put an end to Pure’s ambitions. The company entered receivership — a sort of alternative form of bankruptcy — in July, per filing documents in King County, Washington, where it is based. In August it was also reported that a planned multi-million-dollar factory in West Virginiawould not be going forward. The documents describe numerous creditors, from individual investors to banks to the big one, GM, which put approximately $35 million into the venture. That wasn’t all cash, though: listed among Pure’s assets is some $25 million worth of “manufacturing support,” “know-how,” licensing of the name, and other forms of non-pecuniary goods. (This type of in-kind investment is fairly commonplace.) On the asset side, we find $3.6 million in “finished goods,” likely the assembled motors and battery units built by Pure, though why those would not have gone out to the more than 900 people who paid a down payment is unclear (nor is whether refunds will be issued). Another $25.5 million of “raw materials” is also listed, but what this may be is unclear — other documents detailing sale of assets like boats and batteries don’t come near that sum. TechCrunch has asked both Pure and GM for comment on the matter. GM did not offer a substantive response and we have not yet heard back from Pure. Electric watercraft is a growing but still nascent industry, with startups likeCandela,Navier,FleetZeroandZin Boatsmaking a play for cleaner, more efficient waterways and infrastructure.

"Moksha, the gamified meditation device, makes breath work exercises more engaging",Lauren Forristal,2024-09-21T08:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/21/moksha-gamified-meditation-device/,Gadgets,"Comment Moksha’s meditation tool aims to kick traditional breath work exercises to the curb. As most breathing tools on the market are designed to do,Mokshaaims to help train you to breathe longer and deeper, whichstudieshave shownnaturally calm you down, relax your muscles, slow your heart rate, and stabilize your blood pressure. The smart breathing device — now available on the company’swebsiteafter launching onKickstarterlast year with over 400 preorders — is a sleek metal pendant with a mouthpiece that you can inhale and exhale through. The idea for the Gamified Meditation Tool, as the company calls it, is that by inhaling and exhaling through a small cylindrical structure, you can better control and slow your breathing. Yash Ghanekar and his co-founder Jaymin Shah came up with the idea for Moksha after dealing with some personal things that affected their mood and well-being. “My close friend had passed away, and it really triggered my anxiety to new heights. I always dealt with general anxiety and just the stress of school and social situations, but this took it to a new level, where I was having panic attacks night after night,” Ghanekar told me. Shah’s brother, a doctor, told them about the benefits of breath work, and it inspired them to collaborate with R&D experts, data scientists, mechanical engineers, and designers to build their flagship device, theBeam, a $43 necklace with a metal pendant attached to it. It also comes with afree stand-alone app. “The feedback was remarkable. We got all kinds of people reaching out to us, saying that it saved their lives. People were coming to us with all kinds of collapsed lung disease conditions, with PTSD, with anxiety, and saying that this breath work tool is really helping them,” Ghanekar said. After the success of its first device and app, the company decided to launch a smart tool that merges the two products. The most unique selling point of the Gamified Meditation Tool is that it features air pressure sensors and haptic feedback technology to help beginners learn how to breathe and meditate properly. After inhaling for 2 to 8 seconds (depending on the type of meditation exercise) andthen exhaling for 5.5 seconds, the device vibrates as a signal to begin inhaling again, eliminating the need to count in your head and helping you stay focused. This is indicated by a light buzzing feeling on your fingertips. When connected through Bluetooth, it can also track your breathing data. Notably, Moksha designed its device to resemble a vape or cigarette. The company hopes this will help redirect smokers from unhealthy habits. “Our idea is to move everything away from this oral fixation of vapes and weed pens and move it more towards mental health,” Ghanekar said. Moksha claims the device is nickel- and lead-free and doesn’t contain “chemicals or toxins that may injure your respiratory health.” The mouthpiece can be removed for easy cleaning or replaced with a new one. Its portable charging case provides up to 60 hours of battery life. The tool’scompanion iOS appoffers breath control games, playlists, and meditation exercises to make breath work more engaging. The app offers five breath work categories that all provide different benefits: Calm, Energy, Morning, Recovery, and Sleep. Each exercise follows a similar format: a brightly colored circle expands and contracts to help you center your breathing, accompanied by calming music or nature sounds in the background. It’s the addition of the breathing tool that Moksha thinks will help people feel confident that they’re doing the breath work correctly. An enjoyable part of testing was playing the breath control game known as Copter. In this game, the player maneuvers a ball through the sky, dodging clouds by using controlled inhalation and exhalation to guide the ball up and down. While addictive, it reminded me that I should practice breath work more frequently. (Why was I so bad at something as basic as breathing?) It also reminded me of existing medical tools, such asthe incentive spirometer, which acts as exercise equipment for patients to maintain strong lungs. Similar to many traditional meditation apps, it monitors meditation sessions and maintains a daily log of users’ moods and thoughts. The smart breathing device costs $150, which may seem like a steep price for something that gets you to do a thing you do every day for free. But the price is comparable to other meditation devices:Moonbird, which you hold in your hand, costs $199; andThe Shift, another breathing device, retails for between $65 and $340, depending on the material it’s made out of. I’ve attended several breath meditation courses before in an attempt to alleviate my anxiety, but I always struggled to get into it and make it a regular habit to see real results. However, after using Moksha for nearly a month, I can say that it has made the practice a bit less boring for me. Admittedly, it’s still not a daily part of my routine, but I find myself gravitating toward it before going to stressful events or to wind down after a long week. Moksha also has a new game launching soon, so I look forward to trying that out, too. The handheld device can be used as a stand-alone product, but the app offers some free games and exercises. For $8 a month, you get access to its full library of over 500 breathing activities. Moksha’s app also features a gamified reward system that offers discounts on coffee and clothing for users for simply using the app and, well, breathing. The company teamed up with Instacart, NBA Store, and Fanatics to offer coupons. The company claims to have over $1 million in lifetime sales. To date, Moksha has raised a little under $200,000 from Republic and angel investors. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Tesla Superchargers: All the EV brands that have access,Rebecca Bellan,2024-09-21T07:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/21/tesla-superchargers-all-the-ev-brands-that-have-access/,No category,"Comment Eighteen months ago, Ford triggered a transformation when the U.S. automaker locked in a deal to give owners of its EVsaccess to the Tesla Supercharger network. In a stunning shift, automaker after automaker — from GM and Hyundai to Rivian and Mercedes — followed suit. By the end of 2023, nearly every major automaker had agreed to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and promised EV owners that adapters would soon be on their way. Most non-Tesla customersare still waiting. However, GM’s announcement earlier this week may provide an electric lining of optimism. EV owners of GM vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Cadillac Lyriq will nowofficially have accessto Tesla’s Superchargers. All GM EV owners need to do is purchase, and wait for, the GM-approved adapters that will allow their cars to charge on Tesla’s ports. More may soon follow. TechCrunch is tracking which brands have access to the Tesla Supercharging Network and will be updating this list. In November 2022, Tesla shared its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America. At the time, every other automaker was using the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) in North America. Mass adoption seemed unlikely at the time even though Tesla’s charging network was consideredfar superiorthanks to its robust and user-friendly design and the ease of paying for the EV juice. Six months later, Ford became the first to announce it would work with Tesla in a deal that would give its customersaccessto more than 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. But it wasn’t just about giving Ford EV owners access to a special adapter. Ford also committed to integrating its future EVs with NACS ports instead of CCS. Rivian, GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Volkwagen, Porsche, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid, and Stellantis followed. In the U.S. today, there are 36,499 NACS ports available publicly (although some of those might be fromother EV charging companiesthat have adapted Tesla’s standard), compared to around 16,925 CCS ports. That’s despitefederal dollarsthat have gone explicitly to the buildout of CCS chargers. For EV owners stuck with a CCS port, they’ll have to hold out for manufacturer-approved adapters. While there are some third-party adapters that claim to be compliant with certain safety and performance standards, likeLectron’s Vortex Plugfor $199,Tesla’s websitesays such adapters are prohibited. A GM spokesperson told TechCrunch its adapters have been specifically designed to protect GM EV batteries while charging and that its vehicle warranty doesn’t cover damage to vehicle parts resulting from the use of non-GM approved adapters. In late August, Tesla posted on X that it hadramped up productionof adapters. That statement, combined with GM’s announcement, could mean that even more non-Tesla EVs will be pulling up to Supercharger stations soon. They’ll all have to download the Tesla app so they can pay for charging. As of September 2024, GM has finally updated the software on its Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC EVs so customers can use Tesla’s Superchargers. If they want access soon, they need to purchase a “GM approved” adapter through their app for $225. GM wouldn’t say how long shipping would take. A GM spokesperson said the company already has an inventory of the adapters and that it’s worked with multiple suppliers to manufacture the approved NACS DC fast-charging adapters. From 2025 onward, GM’s EVs will be built with the NACS charge port. Certain Ford customersofficially gained accessto Tesla Superchargers in February, but ongoing supply constraints have delayed the delivery of free fast-charging adapters for most customers (although Ford says the delays have affected “some” customers). Current owners of the Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning who have yet to order their adapter can do so through their Ford Pass app. The deadline to apply for a free adapter is September 30. EV startup Rivian officially got access to 15,000 Superchargers across North America on March 18, 2024. At the time, Rivian promised to begin sending adapters to customersstarting in April. A Rivian spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker began delivery this spring and continues to ship adapters as quickly as it receives them. TechCrunch will update the list as automakers gain official access. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Shelf is a social network based on the media you consume,Jagmeet Singh,2024-09-21T06:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/21/shelf-is-a-social-network-based-on-the-media-you-consume/,Apps,"Comment Social networks have become increasingly homogenous, showing everything from text to short videos across platforms, where algorithms often overshadow your creativity. In this ubiquitous environment, it’s harder than ever to get a genuine sense of someone’s vibe before deciding to follow them. EnterShelf, an app that lets you create a personalized “storefront” of your media habits, then connect with others based on the movies, shows, books, games, and music they consume. It also lets you track progress while reading your favorite book or watching a trending show. “If you observe culture at large on the internet, it’s shifting away from posting selfies to here’s what I’m reading, watching, screenshots of the reviews of my movies and so on. It’s essentially going deeper about a person, trying to understand what they’re in … that’s what Shelf is all about,” said Jad Esber, founder and CEO of Koodos Labs, the startup behind Shelf, in an interview. Esber grew up writing online poetry anonymously, then spent the early years of his career at YouTube in London from 2015 to 2018. During this time, he worked on the creator side of the Google subsidiary, helping people create content, grow their audience, and monetize their work. This was when YouTube grew its creator ecosystem in various emerging markets outside the U.S. After spending over three years at Google, the Cambridge University master’s graduate returned to academia, joining Harvard University to research consumer internet trends and study the internet academically. That eventually helped him conceptualize Shelf in a market full of social media apps with millions and billions of users. “We built many, many products,” Esber told TechCrunch. “They all didn’t work until Shelf, and Shelf emerged from those learnings.” The Shelf app, available on iOS and coming to Android, lets you connect your accounts associated with media, including Apple Music, Goodreads, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, then builds a customizable “storefront” web page that updates automatically based on your consumption progress. You can also manually add links to any other internet service to your virtual shelf — even links to yourfavorite TechCrunch articles, which you can showcase to your followers. The New York-based startup also plans to expand the list of supported services, including Steam for gamers. “[A]s humans and as people online, we’re very multi-hyphenate. We’re not just into music, movies, shows, and all these things. Adding support for certain categories will expand the user base, but at the same time deepens the use case for existing users,” Esber said. You can choose a URL for the digital shelf based on your preference. Likewise, the app lets you customize the interface by changing the background color and moving items depending on your taste. Koodos plans to monetize Shelf by offering new customization options. It could also explore monetizing insights that the app surfaces, Esber told TechCrunch. Unlike apps that call the data using APIs, Shelf works regardless of whether the platform has a first-party API. Generally, when users select a third-party service like Spotify or Apple Music from the Shelf UI, they’re signed in (either via a redirect to that app, or via a pop-up screen). Once the user has signed in, Esber can pull all the information about that user’s media consumption directly from the app. Esber also stated that the startup does not use the data Shelf gets from the services users list on the app to train AI, which has become a common practice among online platforms nowadays. This data-sharing is powered by a technology called DataMover, and Koodos has been working with other apps to expand this solution as well (although Esber wouldn’t say which ones). He compares DataMover with the data transfer network for fintech Plaid. “In a similar way [to Plaid], we’re affording that user provision access to data to other applications, too,” he said. Alongside letting users create their storefronts for the public, Shelf has begun testing a private experience for some users, who only want to track their own media consumption without sharing it. “We intend to be a fun utility that anyone can use over time. Everyone has a bookshelf in their living room or at home. So, why can’t everyone have the Shelf?” Esber said. Launched publicly this summer after its beta testing at the end of last year, Shelf has added half a billion items by its users. Esber declined to share user numbers but said the number of shelves on the app is growing by 40% month-to-month and that users visit Shelf an average of five times a week to check in on or update their digital shelves or keep up with others’ shelves. Koodos has raised $7 million in total from investors, including First Round Capital, M13, Blockchain Capital, and IDEO, as well as the founders of companies, including Zynga and VSCO. It also counts Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, Dubsmash co-founder (now Reddit VP) Suchit Dash, and the pioneers of market design at Harvard, Professors John Deighton and Scott Kominers as advisors.

The EU’s 10 biggest antitrust actions on tech,Natasha Lomas,2024-09-21T05:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/21/the-eus-10-biggest-antitrust-actions-on-tech/,Government & Policy,"Comment The U.S. innovates and the EU regulates, or so certain transatlantic punters love to harp. We’re not going to get embroiled in that noise here, but two things are clear: The bloc’s Single Market has its own particular set of rules, and quite a lot of U.S. tech giants have run afoul of European Union competition regulations over the past several decades. Make of that what you will. Earlier this month, as she reveled innailing a couple of major antitrust case appeals against Apple and Google, the EU’s outgoing competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, jokingly referred to Big Tech as some of her best customers. Ouch. We’ve compiled a list of 10 of the biggest EU antitrust actions targeting tech to give a snapshot of the most high-profile — if not always consequential — competition skirmishes between Brussels and industry heavy hitters over the past several decades of digital development. The list is ordered based on the size of the fine or liability involved. While it’s fair to say the EU’s antitrust tech enforcement outcomes have varied, one lasting legacy is that some of these major cases served as inspiration for the bloc’sDigital Markets Act: A flagship market contestability reform that could see major tech players hit harder and faster in the coming years. It’s finally Big Tech’s time to buckle up. No oneenjoyspaying their taxes, even less a demand for unpaid back taxes. But by September 2018, Apple had justfinished handing the EU an eye-watering€13.1 billion(then worth $15.3 billion) after the bloc successfully sued one of its member states, Ireland, over illegal tax breaks granted to Apple between 1991 and 2014. The State Aid case, which falls broadly under the bloc’s competition rules, went back and forth through EU appeal courts. But inSeptember 2024, the Court of Justice affirmed the original August 2016 Commission finding of unlawful State Aid. With the top court weighing in with a final ruling (not a referral back to a lower court), Apple’s legal options to continue challenging the decision are all but exhausted, and the billions in underpaid taxes sitting in an EU escrow account look set to finally pour into Ireland’s coffers. Micromanaging the software that mobile device makers could bundle with its operating system, Android — to get its own wares in front of Android users regardless of the hardware they picked — got Google into costly hot water in the EU in recent years. Around $5 billion worth of antitrust heat, in fact. The2018 Commission decisionsanctioning it for abusing a dominant position was, and still is, a record-breaking penalty for this category of competition abuse. The original EU€4.34 billionfine on Google was revised down slightly, to €4.125 billion, in a September 2022appeal decision by the General Court. However, the judges largely upheld the original Commission decision, rejecting Google’s bid to overturn the enforcement. Back in June 2017,Google was hit with another(at the time) record-breaking€2.42 billionpenalty for abusing a dominant position — this one in relation to how it operated its product comparison service, Google Shopping (previously branded Google Product Search and, before that, the pun-tastic Froogle). The bloc found that Google had not only unfairly favored its own (eponymous) shopping comparison service in organic search results, a market the tech giant has almost entirely sewn up in Europe, but had also actively demoted rival comparison services. The multi-billion-euro fine ensued — worth around $2.73 billion at the time it was announced — and was subsequently affirmed in aSeptember 2024decision by the EU’s top court. The EU branched into a competition theory of harm that accused Apple of consumer exploitation, rather than exclusionary conduct, in this long-running enforcement against Apple’s conduct in the music streaming market on iOS. The bloc’s competition division changed tack a few times, as it investigated iOS developer complaints against the App Store operator. But in March 2024 it ended uphitting Apple with a€1.84 billionfine(around $2 billion) for banning developers from telling iPhone users about cheaper deals available outside Apple’s store. The vast majority of the financial sanction — a full €1.8 billion — was applied on top of the EU’s standard damages calculation, which the bloc said it hoped would act as a deterrent. (Without it, the fine would have been a mere €40 million — or a “parking ticket” level penalty for Big Tech.) Yet another billion+ antitrust penaltyhit Google for abuse of dominancein March 2019, when the bloc sanctioned the company over its search ad brokering business. The Commission found it had used restrictive clauses in contracts with customers between 2006 and 2016 in a bid to squeeze out rival ad brokers. A penalty of€1.49 billion(or around $1.7 billion) was duly imposed. However, in September 2024, despite upholding the majority of the Commission’s findings, the EU’s General Courtannulled the AdSense decisionin its entirety over errors in how the Commission assessed the duration of Google’s contracts. It remains to be seen whether the EU will appeal. The Commission still has another (open) case probing Google’s adtech stack more broadly, which could also make the AdSense case look like small beer. Margrethe Vestagerwarned last yearthat if the suspected violations are confirmed, a structural separation (i.e., breaking up Google) may be the only viable remedy. In 2012, the EU handed down a total of€1.47 billionin fines ina cartels caserelated to the sale of components used in the manufacture of computer monitors and TVs. A raft of electronics giants were caught up in the enforcement over price-fixing of cathode ray tubes (CRT) between 1996 and 2006. The components were used in computer monitors and TVs in the pre-flatscreen era, and the Commission found that hardware makers had colluded to fix prices. Fines were handed down to seven electronics giants that were involved in either one or two CRT cartels, including LG, Panasonic, Philips, Samsung, and Toshiba. Going further back in time, we arrive in May 2009, at what was thena record€1.06 billionantitrust penalty for chipmaker Intelafter the EU found that the U.S. giant had abused a dominant position to exclude rival AMD. Intel had been paying computer manufacturers and retailers to postpone, cancel, or otherwise avoid using or selling AMD’s products, and the EU found these exclusionary practices breached competition rules. The chipmaker appealed the EU’s enforcement with some success over the following decade of legal arguments. In 2017, the Court of Justiceset aside an earlier rulingby a lower court and referred the case back to the General Court, which went on to annul part of the Commission’s decision, while allowing that some of Intel’s practices had been unlawful. The Court quashed the original fine in its entirety, owing to uncertainty over the penalty calculation, butlast yearthe EU reimposed a fine of €376.36 million on Intel — for the “naked restrictions” that the Court had upheld. Appeals still rumble on, so where this enforcement finally ends up remains to be seen. In early 2018, it wasmobile chipmaker Qualcomm’s turnto be hit with a beefy EU antitrust penalty:€997 million(or around $1.23 billion at the time). The sanction was for abuse of a dominant position between 2011 and 2016. The enforcement focused on Qualcomm’s relationship with Apple, and the EU decided it had shut rival chipmakers out of the market for supplying LTE baseband chipsets by paying Apple to exclusively use its chips for iPhones and iPads. However, Qualcomm appealed the decision, and in June 2022 the EU General Courtruled in its favor, rejecting the Commission’s analysis and also finding some procedural faults with its case. The EUlater confirmedit would not appeal the judgment, so this is one sizable antitrust penalty that didn’t make it beyond the headlines. The bloc has had better luck in a separate (longer-running) antitrust procedure against the chipmaker: In September 2024, the General Courtlargely upheld a Commission penaltyon Qualcomm of just under $270 million in a case related to predatory pricing. We have to wind back the clock all the way to March 2004 to arrive at the EU giving Microsoft a spanking for abusing a dominant position with its Windows operating system. The then-record€497 millionpenalty (around $794 million) would be worth closer to €762 million (or ~$1.3 billion) today, factoring in Eurozone inflation (perthis tool). The original complaint sparking the investigation into Microsoft’s licensing and royalties practices dated all the way back to 1993. The EU’s enforcement on Microsoft wasupheld on appeal. As well as handing down a fine, the bloc ordered various remedies, including interoperability requirements, and a second, larger penalty of €899 million was handed down on Microsoft inFebruary 2008for noncompliance. A 2012 decision by the EU’s General Court upheld the noncompliance penalty but reduced the level of the noncompliance fine slightly to €860 million. In anOctober 2017 State Aid case, the EU argued that Luxembourg, the member state where e-commerce giant Amazon has its regional base, had granted the company “undue tax benefits” between May 2006 and June 2014. The Commission found that Amazon’s corporate structure in the country had allowed it to pay four times less tax than other companies based there — a tax break the EU calculated was worth around€250 million. (The EU does not issue fines for State Aid cases but requires any unlawfully uncollected taxes to be recouped.) But while the Commission took issue with Luxembourg’s method of calculating Amazon’s taxable profits in the country, unlike in the aforementioned Ireland-Apple State Aid case, its arguments did not prevail in court: In a final rulinglate last year, the EU’s top court struck down the Commission decision, finding that the EU had not established that the Luxembourg tax ruling was illegal State Aid. The upshot? Amazon was off the hook. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Elon Musk threatened with SEC sanctions for failing to appear in court,Kyle Wiggers,2024-09-20T15:32:59-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/elon-musk-threatened-with-sec-sanctions-for-failing-to-appear-in-court/,Social,"Comment Elon Musk, the CEO of X and various other companies with the letter “X” in their names, is in regulators’ crosshairs after skipping testimony this month in an investigation related to Musk’s takeover of Twitter. In a filing today, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that it intended to seek sanctions against Musk after Musk skipped a court-ordered appearance in a Los Angeles courthouse on September 10. Per the filing, Musk didn’t notify the SEC that he wouldn’t be appearing until just three hours before his testimony was set to begin. “The Court must make clear that Musk’s gamesmanship and delay tactics must cease,” the filing reads. Musk instead spent September 10 overseeing the launch of Polaris Dawn, a spacecraft made by his space exploration company, SpaceX, according to the filing. The SEC’s legal counsel offered to reschedule Musk’s hearing to the following day, September 11. But Musk’s attorney declined, agreeing only to court dates in October. The SEC is seeking “meaningful conditional relief” if Musk doesn’t appear in court in October. The agency also signaled that it plans to file a sanctions motion against Musk to recoup its travel costs for the canceled testimony and other relief. (In the filing, the SEC said that it spent “thousands of dollars” to fly three attorneys to Los Angeles for the September 10 hearing.) Musk’s court-mandated appearancestemsfrom the SEC’s probe looking into whether the billionaire followed the law when disclosing his purchases of Twitter stock before acquiring the company for $44 billion in 2022. The probe also seeks to uncover whether Musk’s statements concerning the deal were misleading; the SEC alleges that Musk waited at least 10 days too long to disclose he was buying Twitter shares. The probe is the second time Musk has been under the SEC’s gun in recent years. In 2018, the agencyorderedMusk to step down as Tesla’s chairman and pay $40 million in penalties over tweets related to Tesla shares that the SEC found to be market-manipulating. At the time, Musk called the fraud charges an “unjustified action.” The SEC has also investigated Musk and Tesla over claims regarding Tesla vehicles’ “full self-driving” capabilities, as well as Tesla’s use of company funds to build Musk a “glass house.” You can read the full filing below. Updated 9/20 at 5:48 p.m. Pacific: We originallywrote that Musk failed to appear in a San Francisco courtroom. The courtroom was in fact in Los Angeles; we’ve made the correction and regret the error.  JOINT STATEMENT REGARDING R…bySP-TechCrunch   Powered byWordPress VIP"

"Musk dodged Brazil’s X ban by ‘coincidence,’ says Cloudflare CEO",Maxwell Zeff,2024-09-20T13:54:01-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/musk-dodged-brazils-x-ban-by-coincidence-says-cloudflare-ceo/,Media & Entertainment,"Comment X went back online in Brazil earlier this week, three weeks after Elon Musk’s platform wasblocked under orders from Brazil’s Supreme Court. That prompted Brazil’s top court to fine X Corp.nearly $1 millionfor every day the platform remained accessible in the country. However, Cloudflare’s CEO Matthew Prince tells TechCrunch that X going back online in Brazil this week was all a “coincidence.” “I don’t think anything about this change was intentional to overcome a block in Brazil,” said Prince in an interview with TechCrunch. “This was literally just [X] switching from one IT vendor to another IT vendor.” Some months ago, Prince said, Cloudflare won a deal to provide X with cloud computing services in several regions across the globe, including Brazil. X had previously used Fastly, a competitor to Cloudflare, and the social media platform is currently in the process of rolling out that switch. Changing providers also changed IP addresses associated with X, which disrupted how Brazilian internet service providers were blocking the X platform. “We have never talked with [X] about helping them get around the Brazilian ban,” said Prince. “They happened to transition a bunch of their traffic from Fastly over to us, especially in the Latin American region, over the last week.” Prince describes this as wild coincidence, where his sales team won a deal, and as a result ended up inadvertently “wading into some geopolitical Elon Musk vortex of craziness” months later. Some may find that a bit hard to believe, given that Elon Musk has tried multiple avenues already to skirt Brazil’s ban on X. Musk tried delivering X directly to Braziliansthrough his Starlink satellitesearlier this month, but later backed down. A spokesperson for X says the platform changed network providers when Brazil shut down X weeks ago, which disrupted its infrastructure throughout the rest of Latin America, in astatementposted on its Global Government Affairs account. So is the timing of all this truly a coincidence? You be the judge. However, Brazilian regulators say Cloudflare has been extremely cooperative in helping to get X reblocked, according toThe New York Times. Brazil implemented its block by requiring ISPs to block traffic to certain IP addresses. When X switched from Fastly to Cloudflare, therefore, the block was no longer in effect. However, Prince claims his company did not know this was going to happen, and even says he doesn’t think X was actively trying to circumvent Brazil’s ban. He even knocked Brazil for using an insufficient strategy to block X. “They chose to implement it in a way which is kind of kludgy, and very fragile,” said Prince. “That assumes that X, Twitter, or whatever we call it, will always be on that IP address… It changed because they switched to Cloudflare, but if X were trying to play games here, they could have switched their IP address very easily without switching to Cloudflare.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Cards Against Humanity sues Elon Musk’s SpaceX  for trespassing,Rebecca Bellan,2024-09-20T13:20:44-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/cards-against-humanity-sues-elon-musks-spacex-for-trespassing/,Space,"Comment Cards Against Humanity (CAH) is suing Elon Musk’s space exploration company, SpaceX, for $15 million after it allegedly dumped construction equipment all over the game company’s private land in Texas. An email,posted on Threads, went out to around 150,000 Cards Against Humanity Saves America donors. Those donors each contributed $15 seven years ago to help the game company buy land on the U.S.-Mexico border in order to protect it from former President Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall blocking out illegal immigration. “Unfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire – Elon Musk – snuck up on us from behind and completely f—-d your land with gravel, tractors, and space garbage,” the email reads. CAH’s complaint, filed against SpaceX on Thursday evening in Cameron County District Court, depicts photos of the property in 2017, which the company has maintained in its natural meadow-like state, a place where it says “wild horses galloped freely in the Texas moonlight.” Those photos were juxtaposed with images of the property today, with dug-up earth, piping, and construction equipment. CAH alleges that SpaceX treated the property as its own for at least six months, clearing the land of vegetation, compacting the soil with gravel, and generally creating an unsafe work site. The company said that when it confronted SpaceX about its alleged disregard for its property rights and trespassing, the space company responded with a 12-hour ultimatum “to accept a lowball offer for half the land’s value.” “We said, ‘Go f— yourself, Elon Musk. We’ll see you in court.’” In the complaint, CAH outlines its method of maintaining trust with its loyal fanbase that it hopes to encourage to stand up against injustice. CAH says it uses pranks and stunts to draw attention to particular issues or “people who ignore the rights and problems of regular people for their own personal enrichment or aggrandizement.” Trump and Musk have been two of CAH’s recurring targets. Neither CAH nor SpaceX immediately responded to requests for comment. CAH said in its email to campaign donors that if it wins this fight, the 150,000 people who donated $15 each in 2017 would get to split the net proceeds from the suit, “so $100 each.” The company also acknowledged that its chances are slim because “Musk has way more money and lawyers than we do, so you’ll probably get, like, $2 tops.” The email also includes a call to action, asking campaign donors to “post on Twitter (the platform he wants you to call X for his own sexual gratification)” to spread awareness about the lawsuit, with a link towww.ElonOwesYou100Dollars.com.

Elon Musk’s X.ai is using Black Forest’s Flux.1 text-to-image model to power image generation in its Grok chatbot. That’s a service that set people chattering immediately after it was launched in part because of the audacious results people generated with it. “No filters” still appears to be a thing a month later. We created the image on the right earlier this week. The company is also catching the eye of investors because of its founders and founding team. They include Andreas Blattmann, Patrick Esser, Dominik Lorenz and CEO Robin Rombach, researchers who created Stability AI, considered a game-changing platform for image generation. “Robin Rombach is known to be an absolute expert at image diffusion models and when you have someone that smart and proven in a brand new space, it makes it obvious one should invest if given the chance,” one of the company’s investors told TechCrunch. It’s not completely clear yet who is investing in the Freiburg, Germany-based startup’s latest round. One source mentioned that Lightspeed — one of the more prolific investors in AI in Europe, backing Helsing, Mistral, Stability AI and others — might be involved. Lightspeed has not yet responded to a request for comment, and neither has Black Forest itself. (We will update the post if they do.) The company’s previous, $31 million round included a high-wattage list of investors. Led by Andreessen Horowitz, others, perPitchBook data, included General Catalyst and Stuttgart VC Mätch.vc, with Nvidia’s Timo Aila, Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe, Apple AI research scientist Vladlen Koltun, entertainment mogul Michael Ovitz, and Y Combinator’s Garry Tan also in the mix. The $1 billion valuation is a big jump on its post-money valuation from that last round, which was a more modest $150 million. (Asked about more funding, Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment for this story.) Rapid fundraising in the area of generative AI has become quite commonplace in the current market: Startups building these tools need the funding to buy compute, to hire talent, perhaps to settle IP licensing agreements, and for marketing and business development to compete against bigger and even more well-funded players. In the case of Black Forest Labs, there are more technology launches coming up soon. The company hasalready said it’s workingon a state-of-the-art text-to-video tool, with an as-yet-unannounced debut date. But the market has been tricky and sometimes unkind to some of the smaller AI players that have raised a lot and now have pressure to deliver. H in Paris, a generative AI startup started by DeepMind alums,raised $220 millionin May of this year. It has already lost three of its five co-founders, allegedly overoperational differences. Aleph Alpha, which has raised more than $500 million, appears to havepivotedto enterprise services over building foundational models. “Getting into a headline position, being put into the spotlight, but not delivering,” was how another investor who talked to TechCrunch described the predicament that companies like Aleph Alpha and H have faced. Black Forest Labs will naturally try to avoid such issues, especially since — at least for the moment — it lacks a strategic investor that might prop it up with giant amounts of cash to grow more aggressively. Said this same investor: “I think they will try to go down the other road, the one of staying as secretive as possible.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Here are the hottest product announcements from Apple, Google, Microsoft and others so far in 2024",Christine Hall,2024-09-20T12:40:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/hottest-apple-products-google-microsoft/,Gadgets,"Comment If you love gadgets and gizmos, this year’s product conferences have been right up your alley. We’ve poked through the many product announcements made so far this year by the biggest tech companies and trade shows to create a list of what we think are the most important, or the most interesting, reveals. So far this list covers Apple WWDC, Apple Let Loose, Google I/O, Microsoft Build, Mobile World Congress and CES. Please check back as we’ll continue to update what’s below. No surprise thatApple’s annual September eventincluded a brand new iPhone. This one,dubbed iPhone 16, was “designed around Apple Intelligence, from the ground up,” CEO Tim Cook said at the time, though news out of the event was that buyers of the new models will have to wait a bit before all of the AI features are available. Still, it’s got other new features. The 48-megapixel camera offers a 2x telephoto lens, includes autofocus, and it can capture up to 2.6x more light for low-light images. It can also shoot in macro, and the new vertical design allows the handset to capture Spatial Photos and Videos that can be viewed on the company’s Vision Pro. Along with the base 16 model, Apple also released theiPhone 16 ProandiPhone 16 Pro Max, both of which feature the new A18 Pro chip. The models come in 6.3- and 6.9-inch displays, include a devoted camera button, as well as additional camera features that offer more control both before and after stills and video are shot. Of course, increased battery life is a part of the package. For more specs and to compare the models,check this out. And to find out why Apple added another button to the phones,read this. If you are not among the Ultra set but want a bigger screen and a thinner display than what you’re used to, theWatch Series 10is after your wrists. The screen is “up to 30%” larger, and the body is 10% thinner than the previous model. An updated speaker lets wearers listen to music or podcast episodes from the device; a new charging coil promises to charge it 80% in 30 minutes; and it’ll give you 18 hours of battery on a full charge. But among the biggest changes to the Series 10 are the new sleep apnea detection,which was approved by the FDA, and a depth sensor for use while snorkeling (not scuba diving like with the Ultra) and surfing. AirPods 4 andAirPods 4 with active noise cancellationdebuted at the event, too, with $50 separating the two. Both models feature USB-C charging, while the ANC models bring wireless charging and a built-in speaker for Find My functionality. The new AirPods are powered by the H2 chip, which brings improvements to playback and call sound quality. Charging options increase with AirPods 4 with ANC, as listeners can use a Qi‑certified charger, as well as the typical Apple Watch charger. Version 18 of Apple’s mobile operating system launched without its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, which will be available later this year. But what you do get is a slew of other updates to your oft-used apps that should tide you over for a bit. You can now schedule iMessages and take your pick of emojis to react with; search through your call history; and customize the look and layout of your app icons and Control Center, which now allows you to include third-party apps. Read our full review of iOS 18here. And clickhereto see all the devices compatible with iOS 18. The biggest buzz at this show was the new feature called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). Apple promised its AI will be highly personalized and built with safety at its core.Read more Apple also revealed how developers will soon be able to bring the Apple Intelligence experience into their software, allowing for things like image generation, or new prompts to Siri.Read more Apple is also working with OpenAI to allow its device users to access OpenAI with plans to add options to other LLMs in the future.Read more While you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn’t easy to figure out. The new Passwords app will include new features like a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren’t related to a website or service.Read more The latest operating system version is called macOS Sequoia. One of the biggest features is iPhone mirroring, which lets you control your iPhone from your Mac.Read more As for the latest iOS, iOS 18, one big new feature is that users will be able to lock an app when they hand over their phone to do things like show someone a picture or let them play a game.Read more There were more Apple WWDC announcements as well.Read about the others The iPad lineup is getting a facelift and one of the most important additions is that it now comes in two sizes, the 11-inch display and a 13-inch display. The cost is $599 for the 11-inch and $799 for the 13-inch.Read more The iPad Pro is being touted as the thinnest iPad ever. Features include an OLED display in two panels called Tandem OLED. It also has a nanotextured glass option for less glare. And, it features the next generation of Apple silicon called M4, a jump from M2. In the U.S., the 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999 for the Wi-Fi model, and $1,199 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model. The 13-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,299 for the Wi-Fi model, and $1,499 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model.Read more The M4 chip is the fourth generation of Apple’s custom SoCs. It features a new display engine, as well as significantly updated CPU and GPU cores. Apple claims that the new CPU is 50% faster than the M2 chips that powered the last generation of iPad Pros, while the GPU will offer a 4x increase in rendering performance.Read more Among its many features, the Tandem OLED screen can support an incredible 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness for both SDR and HDR content, and 1,600 nits of peak HDR brightness.Read more Shocking as it may seem, it’s been nearly a decade since the first Apple Pencil was announced, way back in 2015. The stylus hasn’t seen much in the way of updates since then. The most significant arrived in 2018, bringing magnetic charging to the line. Last year, meanwhile, saw the arrival of a less expensive model with fewer features and USB-C charging. Many of the new features with the Apple Pencil Pro come from the squeeze. You can create animations, move and rotate the object and even apply lens blurring.Read more Apple announced a new and improved Magic Keyboard, its keyboard accessory for iPad. The Magic Keyboard has been “completely redesigned” to be much thinner and lighter, Apple says, and now includes a function row for quick access to controls like screen brightness. Beyond that, the new Magic Keyboard features aluminum palm rests and a larger trackpad. Plus it’s more responsive, Apple says, with haptic feedback.Read more There were more Apple Let Loose announcements as well.Read about the others Back in May, Google hosted its annual I/O developers’ conference, and our own Kyle Wiggers took readers you on  journey of all of the company’s AI announcements, including around generative AI and accessibility.Read more It was at the event that Google first gave a developer preview of the new version of its smartwatch operating system, Wear OS 5. This release focuses on improved battery life and other performance improvements, like more efficient workout tracking. Developers are also getting updated tools for creating watch faces and building watch apps.Read more Google unveiled its next generation — the sixth, to be exact — of its Tensor Processing Units (TPU) AI chips. Dubbed Trillium, they will launch later this year. If you recall, announcing the next generation of TPUs is something of a tradition at I/O, even as the chips only roll out later in the year.Read more It also revealed a new Pixel 8a smartphone that is a budget version starting at $499 but is packed full of features.Read more Google’s Pixel Tablet, called Slate, is now available, too. If you recall, TechCrunch’s Brian Heater reviewed the Pixel Tablet around this time last year, and all he talked about was the base. Interestingly enough, the tablet is available without it.Read more Everyone can use a “half” every now and again, and Google obliges with Gemini 1.5 Pro. This, Kyle wrote, is “Google’s most capable generative AI model,” and is now available in public preview on Vertex AI, Google’s enterprise-focused AI development platform. The new version of this LLM supports more tokens, making it more powerful, and has audio-processing capabilities.Read more Back in April, Google Cloud joined AWS and Azure in announcing its first custom-built Arm processor, dubbed Axion. Frederic Lardinois wrote at the time that “based on Arm’s Neoverse 2 designs, Google says its Axion instances offer 30% better performance than other Arm-based instances from competitors like AWS and Microsoft and up to 50% better performance and 60% better energy efficiency than comparable X86-based instances.”Read more There were more Google I/O announcements as well.Read about the others. Copilot+ PCs are Microsoft’s vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware. All include dedicated chips called NPUs to power AI experiences like Recall. And they ship with 16GB of RAM minimum, paired with SSD storage. Copilot+ PCs start at $999.Read more Microsoft’s new Surface devices, the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, focus on performance and battery. The latest Surface Laptop — available with a 13.8- or 15-inch display — has been redesigned with “modern lines” and thinner screen bezels.Read more There were more Microsoft Build announcements as well.Read about the others If you don’t know what haptics are, you will by the end of this article. Brian Heater spoke with Ultraleap co-founder and CEO Tom Carter about adapting the technology for use in automotive and virtual reality. However, that’s not all the company can do with it.Read more The Nothing Phone (2a) is Nothing’s third phone that goes directly after the mid-tier/budget space, with a starting price of $349. Much about the phone is similar to Nothing’s earlier devices, however what’s different is that the Phone (2a) is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chip, a variant built specifically for the device.Read more HTC broke off into a mixed reality division about a decade ago. During that time, Vive’s headsets have gone from a mostly consumer play to more of an enterprise tool. Brian Heater sat down with Dan O’Brien, HTC’s Vive general manager, and John Dabill, the brand’s head of product operations, to discuss Vision Pro, Magic Leap, the metaverse and generative AI.Read more Mike Butcher caught up with Displace founder and CEO Balaji Krishna, who discussed the company’s 55-inch Display Flex product. It’s a “wireless” $3,000 4K OLED TV that sticks to walls without a traditional mounting. Krishna said more versions of the screen, and new features, are coming and hinted at future features based on an “AI-powered shopping engine” letting consumers purchase products from ads, and a contactless payment reader.Read more What’s the maximum size of a device that you will wear on your wrist? If “bigger is better” is your go-to answer, Lenovo has something for you. The company has designed what it’s calling a “rollable concept phone” for Motorola that folds around your wrist. The key word being “concept,” because there is no proof this could become a product. Regardless, it’s fun to see.Read more Xiaomi EV’s first product — the highly anticipated Xiaomi SU7 — is a “full-size high-performance eco-technology sedan” with plans to arrive in China at some point next year. In addition to design, Xiaomi has developed the five core EV technologies: E-Motor, CTB Integrated Battery, Xiaomi Die Casting, Xiaomi Pilot Autonomous Driving and Smart Cabin. And,as mentioned before, it will have the “HyperOS” operating system.Read more Diamonds may be a girl’s best friend, but if you’re a girl who can’t sleep, Samsung’s new Galaxy Ring may be your new BFF. Some of the features include on-board sensors to measure heart rate, movement and breathing to create a cross section of the wearer’s health and sleep patterns.Read more After years of reporting on Xiaomi’s CyberDog, Brian Heater was finally able to see the robotic dog up close at MWC. He got to see the little dog’s dressage shuffle and do a little dance, which he wrote reminded him “of a scaled-down version of Boston Dynamics’ familiar robot.” CyberDog 2 can currently be purchased online for $3,000 — that’s nearly double the $1,600 price point of its predecessor.Read more If you’ve always wanted to look at the back of your desk while working, Lenovo’s new transparent laptop will certainly give you that joy. That is, if it ever makes it to production. It looks like your standard laptop with a few exceptions — the screen has a transparent pane, and it and the keyboard part remind us of an augmented reality experience, meaning the graphics are overlaid on whatever is behind it. For now, Lenovo enjoys showing off its creativity.Read more There were more Mobile World Congress announcements as well.Read about the others One thing is consistent throughout every CES: weird and unexpected gadgets and gizmos appear from unexpected places. We published a rundown of some of the most noteworthy products and services here, which include expensive binoculars with birdwatching AI, voice-absorbing muzzles, pay-as-you-go bathroom access and a router that tries to fit your aesthetic.Read more Supernal’s electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft got a showcase from its parent company Hyundai Motor Group on the ground in Las Vegas, as the so-named S-A2 moves closer to its planned 2028 launch for shuttling passengers. Head here for a full rundown on the aircraft, and the challenges in expanding airborne mobility.Read more Mobinn, a new spinoff from Hyundai, showed off how its new delivery robot can use its flexible wheels to navigate stairs and changes in elevation to drop off deliveries, with tests already being conducted in Korea.Read more We had an early look at Honda’s upcoming 0 Series electric vehicles, a thin and light take on what has typically been a thick and heavy EV trend. The automaker teased two concept vehicles, the Saloon and Space-Hub, and said the first commercial model in its 0 Series EV lineup will launch in North America in 2026.Read more Vietnamese EV startup VinFast also revealed plans this year to get into the electric pickup truck game with the reveal of a new concept called the VF Wild. The truck will have midsize pickup dimensions, and a folding mid-gate to allow the five-foot bed to turn into something functionally closer to an eight-foot bed (when the rear seats are down). The company also officially announced plans to start selling its smallest EV, the VF3, outside of Vietnam.Read more Indian wearable startup Ultrahuman said it was getting into the smart home game with the upcoming launch of connected hardware that’s designed to monitor the “health” of your home, as its marketing puts it. The device, which it’s calling the Ultrahuman Home, has a price of $349 and a shipping date slated to start in July.Read more Pivotal, which is backed by Larry Page, this year launched its U.S. sales of its lightweight electric Helix aircraft, which notably does not require a pilot’s license to be able to fly. That doesn’t mean those paying at least the $190,000 base price will go without mandatory training; a number of rules and regulations still apply.Read more Sony focused on creators; the success of its IP across its gaming, film and streaming studios; and a focus on its partnership with Honda to imagine the mobility space as a “creativity space.” The latter was demonstrated in part by teasing Fortnite in its Afeela car and driving it onstage with a PlayStation 5 controller. Its “digital birth certificate” also reminded us of the brighter side of NFTs,which Haje explains in detail here. Kia’s new EV vans come with a modular twist. In addition to using a modular powertrain, the vehicles will also have modular tops that allow for many different cabin options. But they remain vague on pricing, specs and expected launch dates for this new fleet of commercial EVs.Read more Meet the new and improved Ballie, Samsung Electronics’ home robot, which it previewed earlier this year. It’s around the size of a bowling ball with a battery designed to last two to three hours. Ballie sports a spatial lidar sensor to help it navigate rooms and obstacles, as well as a 1080p projector with two lenses that allows the robot to project movies and video calls and even act as a second PC monitor.Read more Expanding beyond cute, rolling robots, Samsung showcased its wider initiatives for connected homes. Aside from expected UI and feature updates for its existing SmartThings home automation platform, Samsung showed off a “map view” for users that creates an interactive home map that even includes animated avatars of residents and pets.Read more Timekettle announced the X1 Interpreter Hub, a more robust solution, designed for meetings. Timekettle calls it “the world’s first multi-language simultaneous interpretation system.” The system works out of the box, without having to download a separate app. For in-person meetings, two devices are touched together to initiate conversation translation. The handheld devices house earbuds, similar to past Timekettle products. All told, the X1 is capable of supporting up to 20 people at once in five languages.Read more The consumer technology giant unveiled what it touted is “the world’s first” wireless transparent OLED TV. The LG Signature OLED T combines a transparent 4K OLED screen with LG’s wireless video and audio transmission technology.Read more Samsung Electronics showed off a “new generation of products that can be folded inward and outward,” along with “monitor-sized” folding and sliding OLEDs.

Apple breaks down iPhone 16 repair process,Brian Heater,2024-09-20T12:24:41-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/apple-breaks-down-iphone-16-repair-process/,Hardware,No content

The iPhone 16 launches today without its most hyped feature: Apple Intelligence,Ivan Mehta,2024-09-20T11:30:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/the-iphone-16-launches-today-without-its-most-hyped-feature-apple-intelligence/,Hardware,"Comment TheiPhone 16officially goes on sale Friday. But for its earliest adopters, it arrives with a fundamental compromise baked into the deal. Put simply, this is not the iPhone 16 that they were promised. Apple CEO Tim Cook said it would be the “first iPhone built for Apple Intelligence.” But that “for” is key: The handsets actually will not have its most hyped AI features out of the gate. This feels like a turning point for Apple. When it comes to new features on phones, the company may not always be known for being the first to market or for jumping on gimmicks, but it is known for being the best. That’s not the case here. Apple was compelled to board the AI hype train and is thustaking a leap into the half-baked void. Apple has now talked about its Apple Intelligence suite twice — first when announcing the AI suiteat its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, and second during itsSeptember iPhone 16 launch. But in actuality, the company is far behind in terms of shipping features when it comes to its competitors like Google and Microsoft, as well as upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic. The company’s first set of AI tools, announced andreleased in developer betas, are rewriting tools, summarizations of articles and notifications,erasing objects in photos, and audio transcription. Much of this functionality already exists in the market. Apple’s bet is that its decisions around privacy — your usage data is not shared with other users, or with other tech companies, it promises — will be enough to attract buyers. Strictly speaking, the gap between product and feature is not as dramatic as you might think — or at least that is how Apple would defend all this. The iPhone went on sale on September 20, and Apple has promised to start launching its AI features in October. Yet only a handful of features will be made live at that time, and they will only be in U.S. English. (Recall that the company counts heavily on international markets, with North America accounting for just over half of all iPhone unit sales.) And for the more complicated AI bells and whistles, we all still have to wait. The company plans to roll out features likevisual searchand Image Playground starting next month, while additional language support is starting to be rolled out in December — but first with localized English. Other languages willarrive sometime in 2025. The iPhone 16 isn’t strictly necessary for those who want the new AI features. The company has already confirmed that the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max will also get access to the platform. So if Apple Intelligence is going to be a game changer as Apple promises, it’s fair to wonder if the rollout gaps and delays will keep users from upgrading. Or, if we start to see consumers adopt more of a wait-and-see approach — which might also translate to lower sales. However, as my colleague Sarah Perez pointed out, Apple’s AI features could become more useful oncethird-party developers are able to fully integrate them with their apps. That’s worth considering, if and when it happens, but that’s more of a conversation for the iPhone 17. That might well be the point here. Apple is building for the longer term opportunities, and for the first time, it feels like it’s asking buyers to take that leap of faith with it. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Internet surveillance firm Sandvine says it’s leaving 56 ‘non-democratic’ countries,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-09-20T10:57:30-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/internet-surveillance-firm-sandvine-says-its-leaving-56-non-democratic-countries/,Security,"Comment Sandvine, the makers of surveillance-ware that allowed authoritarian countries to censor the internet and spy on their citizens, announced that it is leaving dozens of “non-democratic” countries as part of a major overhaul of the company. The company, which was founded in Canada,published a statementon Thursday, claiming that it now wants to be “a technology solution leader for democracies.” As part of this new strategy, Sandvine said it has already left 32 countries and is in the process of leaving another 24 countries. Sandvine did not name the 56 countries, apart from Egypt, where Sandvine promised to leave by the end of March 2025. For the remaining countries — including non-government customers in Egypt — the “end-of-service” date will be the end of 2025. This change in the company’s direction comesafter years of investigations by Bloomberg, which reported that Sandvine had sold its internet surveillance products to authoritarian regimes, including Belarus, Egypt, Eritrea, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan. Sandvine said that it based its decision to withdraw from the dozens of countries on a review of its operations based onThe Economist Intelligence Unit’s 2023 Democracy Index, which categorizes countries based on their “regime type.” The company also said it made this decision “in consultation with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of State, and other key members of the U.S. government.” Sandvine did not respond to a request for comment, asking the company to provide a full list of the countries that it has already left, and that it is planning on leaving. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Commerce put Sandvineon a blocklist— technically known as the Entity List — accusing the company of selling its products to the Egyptian government, which used Sandvine “in mass web-monitoring and censorship to block news as well as target political actors and human rights activists.” In the last few years, digital rights research groupCitizen Labpublished reports about Sandvine, which also exposed the use of the company’s technology inTurkey and Syria, where Sandvine’s equipment was allegedly used to redirect hundreds of users to spyware. Sandvine’s overhaul appears to show that the pressure applied by the U.S. government actions against the company was effective, according to experts. “For a long time, we knew about the harm but didn’t know what might effectively pump the brakes on out-of-control surveillance tech proliferation,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told TechCrunch. “Sandvine’s tailspin shows that the U.S. model, which includes sanctions, can have a direct positive impact.” Ron Deibert, the director of Citizen Lab, agreed, telling TechCrunch that the Sandvine case “shows what can happen when you have careful evidence-based research, investigative journalism, and public interest advocacy combined with targeted and meaningful government regulations.” In the last couple of years, the U.S. government has targeted other companies that sell surveillance technology. In 2021, the U.S. Commerce Departmentput NSO Group on the Commerce Department’s blocklist, effectively barring U.S. companies from doing business with the Israeli spyware maker, which sells its mobile spyware Pegasus. In 2023, the U.S. government put Intellexa, a consortium that makes the spyware Predator,on the same economic blocklist. This year,the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Intellexa’s founder Tal Dilianand one of his business associates. These sanctions, which specifically targeted Dilian, rather than his companies,have caused other spyware makers to worryabout getting in the U.S. government’s crosshairs themselves.

"M&As and AI are in the spotlight, but there’s still capital left for quick commerce and more",Anna Heim,2024-09-20T10:05:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/mas-and-ai-are-in-the-spotlight-but-theres-still-capital-left-for-quick-commerce-and-more/,Startups,"Comment Welcome to Startups Weekly — your weekly recap of everything you can’t miss from the world of startups. Want it in your inbox every Friday?Sign up here. This week brought reassuring signs that dealmaking is still happening on both sides of the table. New unicorns are being minted, and more capital is flowing into AI, but deals are also coming from some unexpected directions. AI news was plentiful this week, but also varied, from large and small M&As to new launches. AI portfolio: Typeface, a generative AI unicorn,purchased two companiesto expand its enterprise offering: New York City-based Treat, which uses AI to create personalized photo products, and Narrato, an Australian AI-powered content creation and management platform. AI again: Global HR company Workdaybought AI-powered contract management platform Evisort, adding to its AI-related acquisitions. The companies didn’t disclose the price tag, but Evisort had raised $155.6 million in capital and debt. FinOps FTW: IBMacquired Kubecost, a Kubernetes cost optimization startup, as its name suggests. This is another sign of theongoing rise of FinOps, which may also be boosted by the need to lessen the cost and impact of GenAI. Only you: Recently launched SocialAI isa social network with a big twist— it is filled with bots, and that’s on purpose. Founder Michael Sayman told TechCrunch that his goal was for users to be able to bounce ideas off a diverse community of AIs. This week was also busy on the dealmaking front, and some of the capital went to sectors and places you might not necessarily expect. Flying solo: Quick commerce app Flinkraised $150 million,including $115 million in equity. The near-unicorn was once an acquisition target of competitors but is now seeking to forge its own path, with a focus on Germany and the Netherlands. On alert: New York-based startup Intezerraised $33 millionto make sure security teams aren’t overwhelmed by alerts. Using AI, the startup helps them with not only triaging, but also with investigation, which it does much faster than a human would, CEO Itai Tevet said. Getting permits: NYC-based GreenLiteraised a $28.5 million Series A roundto facilitate construction permitting. Its co-founders don’t come from the construction sector but previously worked at Gopuff, which got its own taste of dealing with permits when it tried to launch a ghost kitchen network across the U.S. Tailwinds: Armenian B2B SaaS startup EasyDMARCraised a $20 million Series A round of fundingto simplify email security and authentication.

Apple Intelligence: Its biggest features and when you can expect them,Ivan Mehta,2024-09-20T09:36:25-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/apple-intelligence-its-biggest-features-and-when-you-can-expect-them/,Gadgets,"Comment Apple’siPhone 16 is out, but the company hasn’t made its iOS 18 Apple Intelligence features available to all consumers just yet. In July, Apple rolled out these features to users onthe iOS 18 developer betaand added the AI features forpublic beta users earlier this week. However, if you are not using these experimental versions of the software, then you’ll have to wait a bit to get Apple Intelligence features. Below is a timeline of when these features are expected to arrive. This AI-powered feature will proofread your text, summarize it, or even change the tone to professional, concise, and friendly.Keep in mind that the toolstumbles while handlingswear words and controversial topics like drugs and murder. Applehas given Siri an AI makeoverwith a new animation around the border of the screen. Siri can better understand your requests, including pauses and changes of requests, such as setting a timer for 15 minutes instead of 10 minutes, all in one go. You can also chat with Siri through text by tapping on the bottom of the screen. Siri can also be a how-to assistant, as it now has knowledge of Apple products. For example, you can ask Siri how to change certain settings. Similar toGoogle’s Magic Eraser, the iPhone will gain a feature that helps you remove unwanted objects and people from an image. It can automatically detect unwanted objects, but you can manually draw over them or circle them to select these objects or people. Once you press the cleanup button after selecting, Apple Intelligence tries to fill in the gap without ruining the overall aesthetic of the picture. The new Photos app will be able to create new Memories through prompts, thanks to Apple Intelligence. Apple claims that Apple Intelligence has more knowledge about the contents of an image, so you can also use natural language to search for different photos. Apple will summarize multiple notifications coming from apps like Mail, Messages, and even third-party apps like WhatsApp. With Apple Intelligence, the Mail app will show a one-line summary of all emails and display priority emails on top of your inbox. The AI will also help you to respond quickly to emails by using smart replies. The Phone app will let you record and transcribe calls with iOS 18, and with AI, you can summarize these transcriptions saved in the Notes app. This feature will be available for voice notes that are recorded and saved in the Notes app, too. These features will first roll out to beta users and then to all users later this year and over the next year.  Powered byWordPress VIP"

TechCrunch Minute: Amazon announces AI-powered tools for creating video ads,Anthony Ha,2024-09-20T09:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/video/techcrunch-minute-amazon-announces-ai-powered-tools-for-creating-video-ads/,Commerce,"Comment Businesses that sell on Amazon will have access to new generative AI tools allowing them to create video ads from a single product image. There are actuallytwo related products that Amazon announced— live image and video generator. Both of them are being pitched as a way for sellers to easily create video ads without having to spend time or money on video production or animation. Live images are shorter — they’re basically animated GIFs. For example, Amazon’s promo videos show photos of coffee mugs and flower vases and telescopes being turned into brief animations that might do a better job than a photo of grabbing shoppers’ attention as they scroll past. Video generator is supposed to be more in-depth. Amazon says the tool “curates custom AI-generated videos tailored to a product’s distinct selling proposition and features.” On today’s TechCrunch Minute, we talk about the potential and lingering questions around Amazon’s use of generative AI.

"After X’s ban in Brazil, Tumblr reports ~350% user growth",Sarah Perez,2024-09-20T08:50:37-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/after-twitter-x-ban-in-brazil-tumblr-reports-350-percent-user-growth/,Social,"Comment Bluesky isn’t the only social networking service to benefit from X’s ban in Brazil,now under legal penalties. Tumblr this week is also reporting an increase in both active users and blog creation, the company tells TechCrunch. According to Tumblr, in the days since the X ban in Brazil, the site saw 222.99% growth in communities and 349.55% growth in users. More specifically, Tumblr’s daily active users in Brazil have shot up by 30% from the 110,000 it was seeing, on average, in the days ahead of the ban. What’s more, the new users aren’t just visiting the site, they’re creating accounts, too, Tumblr claims. The company says blog creation and community joins have also increased. (The company didn’t provide metrics on this front, however.) Of those users who joined communities, Tumblr found that the percentage of daily active users in Brazil was also five times higher than those in the rest of the world. The increase on Tumblr is not as significant as what’s been happening on Bluesky, however. Following X’s ban in the country, large numbers of Brazilian usersbegan establishing accountson the decentralized social networking startup. At one point, half a million users had joined Bluesky’s service over a two-day period. The company that had just 6 million users as of May 2024 has topped10 millionand continues to grow. Still, any jump in usage could be beneficial for Tumblr, presuming it wants tocontinue to sell adsin the long term. The age-old blogging site and social platform wasacquiredby WordPress.com maker Automattic in 2022for $3 million, down from the $1 billion Yahoo (TechCrunch’s parent company) once paid for it back in 2017. Since then, the company has been losing money at a rate of$30 million per year, CEO Matt Mullenweg said last July. As a result, Automatticabsorbed nearly 140 people from Tumblr’s staff, reassigning them to other projects at the company. More recently, it said it wouldmove Tumblr’s half a billion blogs to WordPresson the back end to improve efficiencies. Powered byWordPress VIP"

LinkedIn has stopped grabbing UK users’ data for AI,Natasha Lomas,2024-09-20T08:14:44-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/linkedin-has-stopped-grabbing-u-k-users-data-for-ai/,Privacy,"Comment The U.K.’s data protection watchdog has confirmed that Microsoft-ownedLinkedInhas stopped processing user data for AI model training for now. Stephen Almond, executive director of regulatory risk for the Information Commissioner’s Office, wrote in a statement on Friday: “We are pleased that LinkedIn has reflected on the concerns we raised about its approach to training generative AI models with information relating to its U.K. users. We welcome LinkedIn’s confirmation that it has suspended such model training pending further engagement with the ICO.” Eagle-eyed privacy experts hadalready spotted a quiet editLinkedIn made to its privacy policy after a backlash over grabbing people’s info to train AIs — adding the U.K. to the list of European regions where it does not offer an opt-out, as it says it is not processing local users’ data for this purpose. “At this time, we are not enabling training for generative AI on member data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and will not provide the setting to members in those regions until further notice,” LinkedIn general counsel Blake Lawit, wrote in an updated companyblog postoriginally published on September 18. The professional social network had previously specified it was not processing information of users located in the European Union, EEA, or Switzerland — where the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies. However U.K. data protection law is still based on the EU framework, so when it emerged that LinkedIn was not extending the same courtesy to U.K. users,privacy experts were quick to shout foul. U.K. digital rights nonprofit the Open Rights Group (ORG), channeled its outrage at LinkedIn’s action into a fresh complaint to the ICO about consentless data processing for AI. But it was also critical of the regulator for failing to stop yet another AI data heist. In recent weeks, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, liftedan earlier pauseon processing its own local users’ data for training its AIs and returned to default harvesting U.K. users’ info. That means users with accounts linked to the U.K. must once again actively opt out if they don’t want Meta using their personal data to enrich its algorithms. Despite the ICO previously raising concerns about Meta’s practices, the regulator has so far stood by and watched the adtech giant resume this data harvesting. In a statement put out on Wednesday, ORG’s legal and policy officer, Mariano delli Santi, warned about the imbalance of letting powerful platforms get away with doing what they like with people’s information so long as they bury an opt-out somewhere in settings. Instead, he argued, they should be required to obtain affirmative consent up front. “The opt-out model proves once again to be wholly inadequate to protect our rights: the public cannot be expected to monitor and chase every single online company that decides to use our data to train AI,” he wrote. “Opt-in consent isn’t only legally mandated, but a common-sense requirement.” We’ve reached out to the ICO and Microsoft with questions and will update this report if we get a response.

She sat down during the COVID lockdown and started coding — now she’s taking on Bolt,Mike Butcher,2024-09-20T07:13:30-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/she-sat-down-in-the-covid-lockdown-and-started-coding-now-shes-taking-on-bolt/,Commerce,"Comment Sitting in Athens during the first COVID-19 lockdown, entrepreneurRania Lamprouwatched online e-commerce exploding because of social distancing. But merchants still struggled with low conversion rates because their checkout processes were complicated, and they had to integrate multiple providers for payments, shipping, and loyalty programs. “I knew there had to be a better way to reduce friction for both merchants and customers,” Lamprou told TechCrunch. So, she thought, why not turn the checkout process into a “checkout-as-a-service” platform that streamlined it for both merchants and shoppers? She started coding in Python. But, she wasn’t alone. Tech giants Shop Pay and Bolt were in the same space, but were focusing on the U.S. market. Europe was less of a focus. Shop Pay, for example, had started back in 2014 and has now raised a total of $982.1 million. So what was Lamprou going to do with her tiny startup, which she’d named Simpler? She brought on two friends she’d known from university, Alex Kyriakopoulos and Spyros Mandekis, started building the team, and they raised their first $1 million pre-seed round. Today, Simpler has over 250 merchants, more than half-a-million registered shoppers, and expects to increase its revenue by 10 times by the end of 2025, said Lamprou. It recently also raised €9 million (about $10 million) in a pre-Series A round to double down in the U.K., Italy and Spain. Participating in the round were VentureFriends, MMC Ventures and Lamda Development. “Yes, Bolt is a big, massive company, but they are focused on the U.S., mostly with handling fraud problems, like chargebacks. That is a very big problem in the U.S., but it’s not so much in Europe,” she said. In Europe, she said, there are different issues: “We have to localize and add all these different solutions, different providers. Every country has different needs, customer preferences, different payment providers, loyalty coupons, etc.” That’s important because European e-commercesales increased 66%from 2019 to 2021. Despite a temporary decline, the market is expected to keep growing, potentially reaching $955 billion by 2028. The solution turned out to be elegant. On Simpler, merchants can outsource payments, shipping and loyalty programs into one system, which, the company says, boosts conversions and reduces complexity. For shoppers, it means a one-click buying experience across multiple stores and channels. “We’re seeing strong demand from both SMEs and enterprise-level businesses,” she said. While Shop Pay is exclusive to Shopify, Simpler is designed for all platforms. And, unlike Bolt, which focuses heavily on the U.S. market, Simpler is targeting the U.K. and Europe. “We’ve built a robust end-to-end solution with three orders of magnitude less funding than Bolt,” she added.

Health insurance startup Alan reaches $4.5B valuation with new $193M funding round,Romain Dillet,2024-09-20T03:31:53-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/20/health-insurance-startup-alan-reaches-45-billion-valuation-with-new-funding-round/,Startups,"Comment Alan, the French insurance unicorn, just signed a multi-faceted deal withBelfius, one the largest banks in Belgium, that includes a distribution partnership along with a significant financial investment in the startup. Belfius is leading Alan’s Series F funding round of €173 million (around $193 million at current exchange rates). Some of Alan’s existing investors are participating once again, namely Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (via Teachers’ Venture Growth), Temasek, Coatue, and Lakestar. If you aren’t familiar with Alan, the company originally started with a health insurance product that complements the national healthcare system in France. French companies must provide health insurance to all their employees when they join. Alan has optimized its core product as much as possible so that its user experience is much better than a legacy insurance provider’s. For instance, Alan has automated many parts of the claim management system. In some cases, you get a reimbursement on your bank account just a minute after leaving the doctor’s office. Over time, the company added other health-related services, such as the ability to chat with doctors, order prescription glasses, and use preventive care content on mental health, back pain and more via its mobile app. More recently, the company has turned to AI to increase its productivity. Earlier this year, Alan shared some metrics about the company’s performance. The company had said that over 500,000 people were covered by Alan’s insurance products, and it could reach profitability without raising another funding round. But Alan said the partnership with Belfius was a good opportunity to grow its customer base in Belgium — the bank will offer the startup’s health insurance products to its own corporate and institutional clients, which represent millions of employees. “This privileged partnership with Belfius, whose transformation over the past decade has been truly inspiring, opens the door to a new era for Alan in Belgium. Belfius’ investment will allow us to accelerate our development and expand our capacity to offer cutting-edge, accessible health products and services to a wide audience,” Alan’s co-founder and CEO, Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve, said in a statement. Since February, Alan has added another 150,000 customers, including at the Prime Minister’s office in France. It expects its annual recurring revenue to reach €450 million (around $500 million) this year. However, Alan isn’t a typical software-as-a-service company, and most of its revenue is set aside to fulfill insurance claims. Still, one thing is for sure — the company’s growth doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Powered byWordPress VIP"

John Mulaney skewers San Francisco tech crowd at Dreamforce,Connie Loizos,2024-09-19T22:28:45-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/john-mulaney-skewers-san-francisco-at-dreamforce/,Media & Entertainment,"Comment Attendees of the giant, annualDreamforceconference in San Francisco love being the butt of the joke. Last year, Seth Meyers entertained them during a 40-minute set that poked fun at the tech industry’s liberal use of self-affirmations. “You are achieving, you are amplifying,you are accelerating,” Meyers said. “‘Architect?’ I saw ‘architect’ used as a verb. I don’t even think architects use ‘architect’ as a verb.” On Thursday, the roasting came courtesy of comic John Mulaney, who, like Meyers, reportedly used elements of his standard routine but leaned into roasting the tech crowd specifically, much to their delight. “Let me get this straight,” Mulaney reportedly said. “You’re hosting a ‘future of AI’ event in a city that has failed humanity so miserably?” Per The San Francisco Standard,Mulaney later observed that “some of the vaguest language ever devised has been used here in the last three days. The fact that there are 45,000 ‘trailblazers’ here couldn’t devalue the title any more.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
Indian filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma abandons human musicians for AI-generated music,Manish Singh,2024-09-19T21:59:34-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/indian-filmmaker-ram-gopal-varma-abandons-human-musicians-for-ai-generated-music/,AI,"Comment Indian filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma is ditching human musicians for artificial intelligence, saying he’ll use only AI-generated tunes in future projects, a move that underscores AI’s growing reach in creative industries. The filmmaker and screenwriter, known for popular Bollywood movies such as “Company,” “Rangeela,” “Sarkar,” and “Satya,” has launched a venture calledRGV Den Music, which will only feature music generated from AI apps, including Suno and Udio, he told TechCrunch. Varma said he will use the AI-generated music in all his projects, including movies. The entire background score on his new feature movie, “Saree,” is also AI-generated, he said. In an interview, Varma urged artists to embrace AI rather than resist it. “Eventually, the music comes from your thoughts. You need to have clarity on what you want the app to produce. It’s the taste that will matter,” he said. The director’s move comes as AI continues to make inroads into creative industries, prompting both excitement over new possibilities and concern about potential job losses. Many high-profile directors, including Oscar winner Christopher Nolan have cautioned against overreliance on AI, asserting that it cannot replace human intuition in artistic creation. India leads the world in film production, churning out between 1,500 and 2,000 movies annually. Its music industry is equally prolific, releasing a staggering 20,000 to 25,000 songs annually. Varma criticized composers for frequent deadline misses and scheduling conflicts, while accusing lyricists of failing to capture the essence of songs. He argued that these human factors often impede the creative process, making music production both time-consuming and costly. AI, he argues, delivers instantly — at “zero cost.” “Human musicians, composers, lyricists, and singers will be vastly affected and then completely disappear in the near future as the apps keep developing at a rapid pace,” he predicted. Varma said he was working with startupsReclaim ProtocolandStory Protocolto secure the IP of his AI-generated songs using cryptographic proofs. He said many of his filmmaker friends and others in the industry are also excited by the potential of AI and he anticipates the technology to make further inroads into the Indian movie industry in the coming years.

Here is what’s illegal under California’s 8 (and counting) new AI laws,Maxwell Zeff,2024-09-19T16:41:57-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/here-is-whats-illegal-under-californias-8-and-counting-new-ai-laws/,AI,"Comment California Governor Gavin Newsom is currently considering 38 AI-related bills, including the highly contentiousSB 1047, which the state’s legislature sent to his desk for final approval. These bills try to address the most pressing issues in artificial intelligence: everything from futuristic AI systems creating existential risk, deepfake nudes from AI image generators, to Hollywood studios creating AI clones of dead performers. “Home to the majority of the world’s leading AI companies, California is working to harness these transformative technologies to help address pressing challenges while studying the risks they present,” said Governor Newsom’s office in apress release. So far, Governor Newsom has signed eight of them into law, some of which are America’s most far reaching AI laws yet. Newsom signed two laws that address the creation and spread of deepfake nudes on Thursday.SB 926criminalizes the act, making it illegal to blackmail someone with AI-generated nude images that resemble them. SB 981, which also became law on Thursday, requires social media platforms to establish channels for users to report deepfake nudes that resemble them. The content must then be temporarily blocked while the platform investigates it, and permanently removed if confirmed. Also on Thursday, Newsom signed a bill into law to help the public identify AI-generated content.SB 942requires widely used generative AI systems to disclose they are AI-generated in their content’s provenance data. For example, all images created by OpenAI’s Dall-E now need a little tag in their metadata saying they’re AI generated. Many AI companies already do this, and there are several free tools out there that can help people read this provenance data and detect AI-generated content. Earlier this week, California’s governor signed three laws cracking down on AI deepfakes that could influence elections. One of California’s new laws,AB 2655, requires large online platforms, like Facebook and X, to remove or label AI deepfakes related to elections, as well as create channels to report such content. Candidates and elected officials can seek injunctive relief if a large online platform is not complying with the act. Another law,AB 2839, takes aim at social media users who post, or repost, AI deepfakes that could deceive voters about upcoming elections. The law went into effect immediately on Tuesday, and Newsom suggestedElon Musk may be at risk of violating it. AI-generated political advertisements now require outright disclosures under California’s new law,AB 2355. That means moving forward, Trump may not be able to get away with posting AI deepfakes of Taylor Swift endorsing him on Truth Social (she endorsed Kamala Harris). The FCC hasproposed a similar disclosure requirement at a national leveland has alreadymade robocalls using AI-generated voices illegal. Two laws that Newsom signed on Tuesday — which SAG-AFTRA, the nation’s largest film and broadcast actors union, was pushing for — create new standards for California’s media industry.AB 2602requires studios toobtain permission from an actorbefore creating an AI-generated replica of their voice or likeness. Meanwhile,AB 1836prohibits studios from creating digital replicas of deceased performers without consent from their estates (e.g., legally cleared replicas were used in the recent “Alien” and “Star Wars” movies, as well as in other films). Governor Newsom still has 30 AI-related bills to decide on before the end of September. During a chat with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on Tuesday during the 2024 Dreamforce conference, Newsommay have tipped his hat about SB 1047, and how he’s thinking about regulating the AI industry more broadly. “There’s one bill that is sort of outsized in terms of public discourse and consciousness; it’s this SB 1047,” said Newsom onstage Tuesday. “What are the demonstrable risks in AI and what are the hypothetical risks? I can’t solve for everything. What can we solve for? And so that’s the approach we’re taking across the spectrum on this.” Check back on this article for updates on what AI laws California’s governor signs, and what he doesn’t.

Gaming Lyft’s Citi Bike algos was a lucrative side hustle for a while,Kirsten Korosec,2024-09-19T15:29:54-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/gaming-lyfts-citi-bike-algos-was-a-lucrative-side-hustle-for-a-while/,Transportation,"Comment A New York Times article Thursday highlighted alucrative side hustlethat is emblematic of the times we live in: gaming algorithms to earn money. In this case, folks figured out they could maximize the payout from Lyft’s Citi Bike“Bike Angels” programby taking advantage of a company algorithm used to meet its supply-and-demand needs. The practice of “station flipping” — when one or more bike angels move docked Citi Bikes to a nearby empty station, waited 15 minutes and then moved them back — was quashed over the summer, according to Lyft. The company sent an email to the offenders reminding them that earning Bike Angel points through station flipping went against the spirit of the program. “Continued instances of station flipping could result in removal from the Bike Angels program,” the email read. The practice lasted long enough, however, for some bike angels to earn thousands of dollars every month. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Chipmaker Qualcomm lays off hundreds of workers in San Diego,Zack Whittaker,2024-09-19T15:10:58-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/chipmaker-qualcomm-lays-off-hundreds-of-workers-in-san-diego/,Security,"Comment Qualcomm, which makes chips for smartphones, said it will lay off 226 workers in San Diego later this year, according to a California WARN notice published this week. The layoffs, which werefirst reportedby The San Diego Union-Tribune, will take effect the week of November 12. The layoffs affect employees at 16 facilities across San Diego, including the company’s headquarters, which has a cybersecurity presence. It’s unclear if the cybersecurity team is affected, and a Qualcomm spokesperson declined to say when asked by TechCrunch. In a statement, Qualcomm spokesperson Kristin Stiles said: “Our leading technology and product portfolio has positioned us to execute on our diversification strategy. As part of a normal course of business, we prioritize and align our investments, resources, and talent to ensure we are optimally positioned to take advantage of the unprecedented diversification opportunities in front of us.” The decision by Qualcomm to lay off hundreds of employees comes less than a yearafter the chipmaker let go of more than 1,250 workers. During 2023, Qualcommrecorded $35.8 billion in annual revenueand its chief executive Cristiano Amon took home $23.5 million in total executive compensation. Are you affected by the Qualcomm layoffs?

"SpaceX disputes $633K FAA fine, citing ‘systematic challenges’ with agency",Aria Alamalhodaei,2024-09-19T15:07:34-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/spacex-disputes-633k-faa-fine-citing-systematic-challenges-with-agency/,Space,"Comment SpaceXsent a letterto top congressional leaders on Wednesday denying allegations that it violated its launch licenses on two separate occasions last year, which has resulted in regulators seeking $633,009 in penalties from the company. Instead, the company asserts that the inability of the Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) to process “relatively minor” license updates is further proof that the agency is unable to keep pace with the space industry’s — but chiefly SpaceX’s — rapid growth. The FAA announced that it was proposing the fines against SpaceX after the company allegedly failed to follow requirements set out in its launch license on two separate occasions in 2023. In the first instance, the FAA said that SpaceX executed a launch using a new control room and without conducting a launch readiness poll two hours before liftoff; in the second instance, during a Falcon Heavy launch, the FAA alleges that the company used an unapproved rocket propellant farm to fuel the launch vehicle. These changes require amendments to the company’s launch licenses, which the FAA did not approve prior to the launches taking place, the agency says. The combined fines are the largest civil penalty yet levied by the agency against a commercial launch provider. But SpaceX said in its letter that it had separate approval from a U.S. government range safety authority to use the new rocket propellant farm, and that the other changes, like removing the T-2 hour readiness poll or changing the location of the launch control center from one location at Kennedy Space Center to another, are unrelated to public safety and thus not under the regulatory authority of AST. When sent specific questions related to SpaceX’s response letter, an FAA representative directed TechCrunch to thetwo enforcementletters the agencyissued to the company, which site the specific FAA regulations that state that a launch operator must follow the launch plan to the letter. In response to follow-up questions sent by TechCrunch, the representative said, “The FAA does not comment on active enforcement issues.” It is unclear why the FAA is only seeking the fines now, over a year after the alleged violations took place, but SpaceX says in its letter that it’s “notable” that they were announced in the midst of increased scrutiny from Congress over AST’s licensing processes. That includes ameeting earlier this monthof the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which questioned industry leaders, including the FAA head, on the speed and burden of regulations to commercial companies. The FAA’s associate administrator for commercial space transportation, Kelvin Coleman, told the committee that AST currently employed 158 people, the largest ever headcount, after bringing on 35 people in the last year alone. In the president’s budget request for fiscal year 2025, the division is seeking money for additional staffing, Coleman said. This latest quarrel has only intensified SpaceX’s increasingly public campaign against what it sees as ineffectual and untimely regulatory processes. The company has taken to its blog to call out the “superfluous” regulatory delays holding up its next Starship flight, while CEO Elon Musk uses his platform on Xto put his perspective more plain: “The fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA.” But regardless of timing, Billy Nolen, the former acting administrator of the FAA until 2023,pushed back againstMusk’s assertion that the regulatory scrutiny was related to “politically-motivated behavior.” As an agency, the FAA “is about as apolitical as it gets,” Nolen said.

Elon Musk’s reposts of Kamala Harris deepfakes may not fly under new California law,Maxwell Zeff,2024-09-19T15:05:53-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/elon-musks-reposts-of-kamala-harris-deepfakes-may-not-fly-under-new-california-law/,AI,"Comment California’s newest law could land social media users who post, or repost, AI deepfakes that deceive voters about upcoming elections in legal trouble. Governor Gavin Newsom suggests that AB 2839, which went into effectimmediately after he signed it on Tuesday, could be used to reel in the retweets of Elon Musk, among others who spread deceptive content. “I just signed a bill to make this illegal in the state of California,” said Newsom in atweet, referencing an AIdeepfake Musk reposted earlier this yearthat made it appear Kamala Harris called herself an incompetent candidate and a diversity hire (she did not). “You can no longer knowingly distribute an ad or other election communications that contain materially deceptive content — including deepfakes,” Newsom said later in the tweet. California’s new law targets the distributors of AI deepfakes, specifically if the post resembles a candidate on California ballots, and the poster knows it’s a fake that will cause confusion. AB 2839 is unique because it doesn’t go after the creators of AI deepfakes, or the platforms they appear on, but rather those who maliciously spread them. Anyone who sees an AI deepfake on social media can now file for injunctive relief, meaning a judge could order the poster to take it down, or issue monetary damages against the person who posted it. It’s one of America’s strongest laws against election-related AI deepfakes heading into the 2024 presidential election. A sponsor that helped draft AB 2839, California Initiative for Technology and Democracy (CITED), tells TechCrunch this law can impact any social media user — not just Musk — who posts or reposts election-related AI deepfakes with malice. “Malice” means the poster knew it was false and would confuse voters. “[AB 2839] goes after the creators or distributors of content, if the content falls within the terms of the bill,” said CITED’s policy director, Leora Gershenzon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “This is materially deceptive content that is distributed knowing it’s false, with reckless disregard of the truth, and is likely to influence the election.” When asked whether Musk could face legal action for reposting deepfakes, Newsom did not rule out the possibility. “I think Mr. Musk has missed the punchline,” said Governor Newsom at apress conferenceThursday. “Parody is still alive and well in California, but deepfakes and manipulations of elections — that hurts democracy.” Specifically, the new law bans election-related AI deepfakes from TV, radio, phone, texts, or any communication “distributed through the internet.” The bill is not exclusive to political campaign ads, whichother laws have focused on, but also posts from everyday people. AB 2839 creates a window –120 days before a California election and 60 days after — where there are stricter rules about what you can, and can not, post about political candidates on social media. “The real goal is actually neither the damages or the injunctive relief,” said Gershenzon. “It’s just to have people not do it in the first place. That actually would be the best outcome… to just have these deepfakes not fraudulently impact our elections.” This law pertains to candidates for state and local elections in California, as well as federal candidates that will appear on California’s ballot, such as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. If there’s an obvious disclaimer on an AI deepfake, stating that it has been digitally altered, then AB 2839 does not apply to it. Musk is already trying to test the will to enforce California’s new law. Muskreposted the deepfakeresembling Kamala Harris that Newsom referenced in his tweet on Tuesday, amassing more than 31 million impressions on X. Musk alsoreposted an AI deepfakeresembling Governor Newsom on Wednesday, which received more than 7 million impressions. Musk and X are facing other legal problems related to moderation. For instance, a Brazilian Supreme Court judgefined the X Corporationon Thursday for skirting the country’s ban on the platform. The judge previously said X’s failure to combat fake news and hate speech is harming Brazil’s democracy. Powered byWordPress VIP"

FTC report on predatory social media data hoarding hints at future regulations,Devin Coldewey,2024-09-19T13:48:57-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/ftc-report-on-predatory-social-media-data-hoarding-hints-at-future-regulations/,Government & Policy,"Comment A new FTC reporton how social media and streaming sites collect and monetize their hoards of user data doesn’t really feature a lot of surprises for anyone who’s followed the space. It’s more helpful to consider this part of a paper trail the agency is laying down in order to justify new regulations in the space. The report has its roots way back in late 2020, when the FTC ordered nine of the tech companies with the biggest data collection apparatus to disclose numerous aspects of how their surveillance capitalism business models worked. (The companies: Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Snap, ByteDance, Discord, Reddit, and WhatsApp.) What data do you collect, on whom, and how long is it kept? If asked to delete, do you do so? What do you use it for, who do you sell it to, and what dotheyuse it for? The questions are quite comprehensive, the better to avoid the possibility of prevarication or obscuration through withholding of important data. The responses of the companies were, predictably, evasive, as the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine notes in the preface:  Echoing the way that firms conceal and hide their collection practices, many of the Companies provided the Commission with limited, incomplete, or unhelpful responses that appeared to have been carefully crafted to be self-serving and avoid revealing key pieces of information. The resulting report details all manner of shenanigans, representing both malice and incompetence. Few of the practices disclosedwill surprise anyone at this point, but the executive summary starting on page 9 is a great refresher on all the skulduggery we have come to expect from the likes of these. Of course, it has been nearly four years since then, and many of the companies have made changes to their practices or have been fined or otherwise chastised. But despite theelevation of Lina Khan to chair of the FTC subsequent to this inquiry, there has been no large revision or expansion of rules that lay down bright lines like “thou shalt not sell data on a user’s health challenges to advertisers.” One exception you might hope for, compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, also seems to be an afterthought. As the FTC writes:  In an apparent attempt to avoid liability under the COPPA Rule, most [social media and video streaming services] asserted that there are no child users on their platforms because children cannot create accounts. Yet we know that children are using SMVSSs. The SMVSSs should not ignore this reality. … Almost all of the Companies allowed teens on their SMVSSs and placed no restrictions on their accounts, and collected personal information from teens just like they do from adults. Metaallegedly ignored obvious violations for years; Amazonsettled for $25 million after “flouting” the law; TikTok owner ByteDance is thetarget of a similar lawsuit filed just last month. So what’s the point of the report, if all this is known? Well, the FTC has to do its due diligence, too, when considering rules that could restrict a bunch of multi-billion-dollar global tech companies. If the FTC in 2020 had said, “These companies are out of control, we propose a new rule!” then the industries impacted would quite justifiably challenge it by saying there is no evidence of the kind of practices the rule would prohibit. This kind of thing happened with net neutrality as well: The broadband companieschallenged it on (among other things)the basis that the harms were overstated, and won. ThoughChair Khan’s statementaccompanying the report suggests it will help inform state and federal lawmakers’ efforts (which is likely true), it is almost certain that this will provide a foundational fact basis on which to build out a new rulemaking. The very fact that the companies both admit to doing these things, and that they have been caught red-handed doing others in the meantime, would strengthen any argument for new regulations. Khan also fends off dissent from within, from Commissioners who (despite voting unanimously to issue the report) accuse it of attempting to regulate speech or dictate business models. She dispatches these arguments with the confidence of someone already drafting a proposal. That proposal (should it exist) would likely be aimed at trimming the wings of those companies that have come to embody entire industries within themselves. As Khan puts it:  It is the relative dominance of several of these platforms that gives their decisions and data practices an outsized impact on Americans. When a single firm controls a market and is unchecked by competition, its policies can effectively function as private regulation. A consolidated market is also more susceptible to coordination with — or cooptation by — the government. Unchecked private surveillance by these platforms creates heightened risk of improper surveillance by the state. How these markets are structured can result in greater risks to— or greater protections of — people’s core liberties. In other words, let’s not leave it to them, and the FTC likely doesn’t intend to.

This robotic knee exoskeleton is made from consumer braces and drone motors,Brian Heater,2024-09-19T12:25:34-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/this-robotic-knee-exoskeleton-is-made-from-consumer-braces-and-drone-motors/,Biotech & Health,"Comment Robotic exoskeletons are an increasingly popular method for assisting human labor in the workplace. Those that specifically support the back, however, can result in bad lifting form by the wearer. To combat this, researchers at the University of Michiganhave builta pair of robot knee exoskeletons, using commercially available drone motors and knee braces. “Rather than directly bracing the back and giving up on proper lifting form,” U-M professor Robert Gregg notes, “we strengthen the legs to maintain it.” Test subjects were required to move a 30-pound kettlebell up and down a flight of stairs. Researchers note that the tech helped them maintain good lifting form, while lifting more quickly. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Apple, Google wallets now support California driver’s licenses",Aisha Malik,2024-09-19T11:54:18-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/apple-google-wallets-now-support-california-drivers-licenses-and-state-ids/,Apps,"Comment California residents can now store their driver’s license or state ID in their Apple Wallet apps, the state’s governmentannouncedon Thursday. California started allowingdigital IDs through Google Walletjust last month. Californians with an ID in the Apple Wallet or Google Wallet app can use their mobile devices to present their ID in person at select TSA security checkpoints and businesses. They can also use the app to verify their age or identity in select apps. Other states that already support digital driver’s licenses and state IDs includeArizona, Colorado, Georgia,Maryland, and Ohio. To load your ID into the Apple Wallet app, you need to click on the “+” button at the top of the screen in the app, then choose “Driver’s License or State ID.” From there, you need to follow the on-screen instructions to start the setup and verification process. You will prompted to take a selfie and then scan the front and back on your driver’s license or state ID card. To do so in the Google Wallet app, you need to tap the “Add to Wallet” option in the app and then select the “ID card.” Then you need to select your state and follow the verification steps with your physical ID. “We’re partnering with two iconic California companies — Apple and Google — to provide convenient, private and secure driver’s licenses and ID cards directly on people’s phones,” said California governor Gavin Newsom in astatementannouncing the program earlier this year. “This is a big step in our efforts to better serve all Californians, meeting people where they’re at and with technology people use every day,” he added. The governor’s website noted that more than 500,000 Californians have already added a mobile driver’s license (mDL) to their phone using the California DMV Wallet app. The mDL pilot program has been limited to 1.5 million participants. According to theSecure Technology Alliance, more than 20 states are currently exploring the idea of adopting mobile digital licenses. These states include Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming. This article was updated to reflect that Californians can now add their digital IDs to Apple and Google Wallets. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Virtuous, a fundraising CRM for nonprofits, raises $100M from Susquehanna Growth Equity",Marina Temkin,2024-09-19T11:03:38-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/virtuous-a-fundraising-crm-for-nonprofits-raises-100m-from-susquehanna-growth-equity/,Venture,"Comment I recently adopted a kitten from a local animal shelter. The modern, well-staffed three-story facility relies almost entirely on donations to operate. It’s just one of the1.8 million nonprofitsin the U.S. that need to continually solicit contributions from donors to maintain its services. ButVirtuousfounder and CEO Gabe Cooper says that many charitable organizations are not very effective at marketing to their donors. “If you’ve ever given to a nonprofit before, what you probably got back was a piece of direct mail that felt like institutional nonsense that was disconnected from the reason you gave originally,” he said. “Donors deserve a personal connection with the causes they care about most.” In 2014, that realization inspired Cooper to found Virtuous, a customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing platform that helps nonprofits increase donations. Since then, the Phoenix-based company has attracted more than 10,000 customers at various nonprofits, including Ronald McDonald House, Habitat for Humanity, and Arkansas Children’s Hospital, and has seen significant growth, quintupling its revenue in the last three years alone. That rapid growth has piqued the interest of several growth equity investors who wanted to invest in the company. On Thursday, Virtuous announced that it raised $100 million from a single investor, Susquehanna Growth Equity, which is taking a minority position in the company. Cooper said he didn’t have plans on raising new funding this year, but several shifts in the industry, especially the integration of AI, have convinced him that this is an opportune time to have more capital. Although Cooper declined to share Virtuous’ new valuation, he said that the revenue “valuation multiple was consistent with previous rounds.” Since Virtuous’ revenue grew 500% since it raised an $18 million Series B in July 2021, Cooper’s statement about the multiple implies that valuation increased fivefold (an assumption that he declined to confirm). While several companies offer CRMs for the nonprofit space, including aproduct from Salesforce, Cooper said the startup’s main competitor is Blackbaud, a publicly traded company with revenues over$1 billion a year. Cooper claims that Virtuous helps nonprofits understand the interests of their donors better than its competitors. The company achieves this by tracking email opens, website visits, and other data-driven analyses that Virtuous calls “responsive fundraising.” Cooper added that the Virtuous approach to customer segmentation and marketing is similar to that ofKlaviyo, but it’s designed specifically for philanthropic fundraising. By tailoring outreach to specific donors, Virtuous can increase the size of donations. “Our competitors don’t do that. Their [approach] is very impersonal,” Cooper said. The new funding is being used to expand Virtuous’ customer relationship team and, of course, to develop new AI functionality that it plans to make available to customers in early 2025. Cooper said that new AI features are being tested internally, including natural language querying (that allow users to forgo tedious custom searches and report building). The new AI functionality was developed using the OpenAI platform “at a hackathon with the team at Microsoft,” Cooper said. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"No, the FAA isn’t fining SpaceX because of Elon Musk’s politics, former FAA head says",Margaux MacColl,2024-09-19T11:03:26-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/no-the-faa-isnt-fining-spacex-because-of-elon-musks-politics-former-faa-head-says/,Transportation,"Comment This week, Elon Musk identified a new constraint for his Mars-bound ambitions. It wasn’t the -85°F surface temperature, or the 140 million miles he’ll need to travel. Rather, it’s something far more pedestrian: “The fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA,”he posted on X. That post followeda previous onein which he vowed to sue the government agency, arguing in a series of X posts that the FAA was politically motivated when itlevied $633,009 in fines against SpaceXon Tuesday. One fine was for allegedly using an unapproved rocket propellant farm in a launch last year; the other was for using an unauthorized launch control room. SpaceX said in a letter to Congress Thursday it“forcefully rejects”the notion that the company didn’t follow FAA launch procedure. “The FAA space division is harassing SpaceX about nonsense that doesn’t affect safety,”Musk posted, adding, “I am highly confident that discovery will show improper, politically-motivated behavior by the FAA.” But Billy Nolen, the former acting administrator of the FAA in 2023, pushed back against Musk’s assertion that the FAA was unfairly targeting SpaceX because, as Musk implied, the billionaire’s choice of political candidates to support. As an agency, the FAA “is about as apolitical as it gets,” he told TechCrunch. Nolen, who is now the chief regulatory affairs officer of aircraft company Archer Aviation, pointed out that FAA heads purposefully have five-year term limits. That means presidential administrations don’t automatically get to appoint a new FAA leader each time a new party is sworn in. “We don’t operate on behalf of Republicans or Democrats,” he said. Musk’s meatier complaint was about the perpetual slowness of the agency. “It really should not be possible to build a giant rocket faster than the paper can move from one desk to another,” Musksaid at theAll-In Summit on September 10. That was an argument that Nolen could empathize with. The FAA, he said, is burdened with an enormous mandate, yet “there’s never enough money.” The roughly $24 billion budget he was given during his time at the agency may seem like a lot of money. But, he said, about $19 billion was committed to salaries and operations and about $4 billion went to upkeep on an increasingly aging infrastructure. “The agency still has a lot of legacy systems,” he said, pointing out that the FAA itself maintains over 200 ​​air traffic control towers. “Some towers are still using paper strips,” he said, referring to how some towers are still tracking flights on paper. Nolen said that the agency often doesn’t have the budget for new technologies that could help it better regulate a rapidly growing space industry. “The FAA has to be funded to the level of what our expectations are of having a world-class, best-in-class system,” he said. Now that Nolen is at Archer, a company working on newfangled electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft — one of the upstarts that tends to chafe against FAA bureaucracy — he’s thought a lot about what agency changes could help new technology. Within his lifetime, he wants the FAA to become “100% fully predictive” using artificial intelligence, he said. Think of the sheer amount of data soaring through the sky every minute: A single Boeing 787 flight generates a half terabyte of data,according to a 2017 interview with a Boeing engineer. Imagine, Nolen said, “the ability to pull all of that together, synthesize it and say, is there anything in that data that gives us pause?” He emphasized that it would help the agency move faster and speed up approvals for things like, say, SpaceX launches. But Nolen also points out that the FAA relies heavily on experts, turning to engineers, founders, and academics to guide its policy, and Musk’s anti-FAA rhetoric is damaging. Nolen said it’s crucial for someone like Musk, who is “one of the greatest creative minds we have,” to cooperate and help the FAA understand what new age space companies need. “We don’t ever want to be in a place where there’s one set of rules, but if you’ve got enough money, they don’t really apply to you,” he said.

Apple Intelligence is now live in public beta. Here’s what it offers and how to enable it.,Brian Heater,2024-09-19T10:47:47-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/apple-intelligence-is-now-live-in-public-beta-heres-what-it-offers-and-how-to-enable-it/,Apps,"Comment Apple Intelligence took another major step toward mainstream availability Thursday with the launch of the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 public betas. Starting Thursday, those who are enrolled in Apple’s public beta program will be able to experience the generative AI-fueled platform the company has been talking up since June. For the time being,Apple Intelligenceis only available in U.S. English. The feature is also indefinitely unavailable in both the EU and the People’s Republic of China, owing to regulatory hurdles. Those in the States can access the feature with the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and any member of the newly unveiled iPhone 16 line. TechCrunch has been putting the developer beta of iOS 18.1 through its paces as part of ouriPhone 16 Pro Max review. There are a handful of standout features, including cross-system writing tools, Clean Up for Photos, and thebiggest revamp to Siri since launch. Writing Tools takes advantage of the kinds of generative AI features familiar to anyone who has played around with ChatGPT and its ilk. Along with proofreading and summarizing, the system will rewrite text in a variety of styles, including professional, concise, and friendly. Over in Mail, users gain a Smart Reply feature, message prioritization, and summaries. Siri gets a big face-lift, beginning with how the smart assistant is presented on-screen. Gone is the colorful Siri icon in the bottom of the screen, replaced by illuminated borders that won’t obscure text. Siri can also better understand when you trip over your words, and for instances when you can’t speak to the assistant, you can type instead. The last major Siri feature dropping Thursday is product knowledge, wherein users can ask the assistant how to perform a variety of different on-device tasks, from screen recording to resetting an AirTag. Features like conversational and app context and Visual Intelligence are still on the way. On the Photos front, the most interesting addition is Clean Up, Apple’s answer to Google Magic Eraser. After circling an object with your finger, the tool goes to work removing it by generating a background over it. Search has been improved within the app to accommodate more natural language queries, and users can now generate Memories via a text prompt. Users must manually enable the feature by going to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > Join the Apple Intelligence waitlist. Joining the public beta programs, meanwhile, is as simple as visiting beta.apple.com. Additional Apple Intelligence features are set to roll out later this year. Powered byWordPress VIP"

The latest news cycle is a good reminder that even a grizzled old reporter who thinks she has seen it all can still be surprised — and nothing lasts forever. Intrigued? Read on. Welp, it sure is getting spicy over atTuSimple, according to several little birds. The company disclosed last month a new business segment focused on — wait for it — AI-generated animation and video gaming. That action, our little bird network told us, has prompted backlash among some shareholders. Now it seems afight is brewing over roughly $450 million in funds, the bulk of which remains in the United States. And arguments over the company’s mission lie at the center of it. TechCrunch reporters Rebecca Bellan and Rita Liao chased down the story, and there are quite a few interesting details. For instance, TuSimple was beefing up its autonomous vehicle workforce in China late last year but then changed course in early 2024. Hundreds were laid off, although when asked, CEO Cheng Lu told Rebecca that these folks (about 500) resigned en masse. Where does TuSimple go from here? There have been threats of lawsuits, although nothing new just yet. While the threats loom in the background, TuSimple is moving forward with development of an animated feature film and video game based on the science-fiction series “The Three-Body Problem.” This whack-a-doodle pivot had me thinking: Sheesh, maybe I’ve been covering this industry simply too long.

Deal flow in the transportation industry is a bit light this week. Here are some highlights. Alaska Airlinescompleted its$1.9 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. The acquisition is yet another example of consolidation in the airline industry. AIfleet, a trucking tech startup,raised $16.6 million in a Series B funding roundled by Tom Williams at Heron Rock. Notably, Volvo Group VC participated, along with Obvious Ventures, Ibex Investors, Compound, Winthrop Square, and Cooley. The company has raised $50 million to date. Clean Electric, an Indian battery tech startup,raised $6 millionin a funding round co-led by Info Edge Ventures, Pi Ventures, and Kalaari Capital. Lok Capital and other investors also participated. SiLCreceived anundisclosed investmentfrom Honda to develop next-generation FMCW lidar solutions for all types of mobility. ZeroAvia, a startup developing hydrogen-electric (fuel cell-powered) engines for planes, extended its Series C financing round to atotal of $150 million, with an investment from Scottish National Investment Bank. The round was co-led by Airbus, Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital, and NEOM Investment Fund, with UK Infrastructure Bank joining as a cornerstone-level investor. Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Horizons Ventures, Ecosystem Integrity Fund, Summa Equity, Alaska Airlines, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, and AP Ventures also participated. Oxa, a Google-backed startup developing software for autonomous vehicles,acquired industrial logistics company StreetDronefor an undisclosed sum. Motionalpresident and CEOKarl Iagnemma— an early pioneer in the AV industry —has stepped down from the top leadership spot. CTO Laura Major is now interim CEO. Whether Major keeps that position is unknown. My inside sources suggest this is very much an evolving situation. Stay tuned. WaymoandUberexpanded their relationship in a deal that is bigger than some folks might realize. Uber users in Austin and Atlanta will be able tohail Waymo robotaxisthrough the app in early 2025 as part of an expanded partnership between the two companies. Why so notable? For one, Uber, not Waymo, will be the operator. Faraday Futureis doling outbig raises and bonusesto its CEO and its founder.

Cruise robotaxis return to the Bay Area nearly one year after pedestrian crash,Sean O'Kane,2024-09-19T10:24:10-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/cruise-avs-return-to-bay-area-year-after-pedestrian-crash/,Transportation,"Comment Cruiseis returning to the streets of Sunnyvale and Mountain View for the first time since it paused operations in the Bay Area after a robotaxi struck a pedestrian in October 2023. The company said Thursday that it will put “several” vehicles driven by humans in the two cities that will initially perform mapping. The company said it hopes to progress to supervised AV testing of up to five robotaxis “later this fall.” “Resuming testing in the Bay Area is an important step forward as we continue to work closely with California regulators and local stakeholders,” the company said in aposton X. “This will allow our local employees to engage directly with our product as they refine and improve our tech through R&D.” The decision to bring Cruise’s autonomous Chevy Bolts back to the Bay Area comes just a few months after the company reached a settlement with California’s Public Utilities Commission. As part of that deal, Cruise paid a $112,500 fine for failing to provide full information about the October 2023 crash. That crash, which involved a Cruise AV hitting and then dragging a pedestrian after she was struck by a human-driven car, kicked off a series of events that ultimately led to arestructuringof the robotaxi company. Shortly after the crash, Cruise divorced itself from much of its leadership team, includingco-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt. Parent company General Motors installed new leadership and, this past June,pluggedanother $850 million into the robotaxi subsidiary. (Cruise alsosettledwith the pedestrian earlier this year.) Since June, Cruise slowly returned its AVs to the streets ofPhoenixandDallas, andsimultaneously scrapped its purpose-built robotaxi, known as the Origin. Cruise also issued a series of software updates toresolve a recall of its robotaxis, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed a probe into reports of braking problems. In August, Cruise announced that it had signed a multi-year partnership agreement with Uber to bring its robotaxis to the ride-hailing platform in 2025 — joining rival Waymo, which has had its robotaxis available on Uber’s platformsince2023.

"For $5, Photon Library brings back the feel of the old iOS Photos app",Sarah Perez,2024-09-19T10:14:08-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/for-5-photon-library-brings-back-the-feel-of-the-old-ios-photos-app/,Apps,"Comment A new app is offering an alternative to those who aren’t pleased with the iOS 18 Photos app “upgrade.” Capitalizing on the consumer backlash over Apple’s now one-page, tab-freeredesign of its default Photos app, photography app makerLateNiteSoftis introducing a new app calledPhoton Library. It not only serves as a complement to itsother photography apps and photo editing tools, but it also offers the familiar look of the old iOS Photos app found in iOS 17 and earlier. The company said it was inspired to create an alternative Photos app after seeing how frustrated iOS 18 early adopters were with Apple’s new design. Since its debut in the iOS 18 betas, iPhone owners have been lamenting the changes coming to the Photos app. Though the redesign offers better customization, many believe the app’s new looktakes a step back in terms of usabilityby cramming everything into one page. Pages on Reddit arefilled with user complaints.Reviewers are calling it theirbiggest gripewith the iOS 18 software update. Meanwhile,severaltechsiteshave begun offering tutorials on how to customize the redesigned app to make it more useful — and more like the older version. Photon Library offers another alternative. Now, instead of trying to get comfortable with the changes in Photos, Photo Library offers a way for users to simply return to the older-style look and feel of Photos, albeit in an experience built by a third party. The app brings back a tabbed design and includes other Photos app features like basic photo grids, a list of albums you can scroll through, and quick access to your Favorite photos. Rather than scrolling down the screen as in iOS 18’s Photos app, the bottom tabs of Photon Library let you quickly access your recent photos, your albums, a calendar view, or your favorites. This is slightly different than the iOS 17 Photos app, which offered tabs for the Library, Albums, “For You,” and Search, but the company thinks its tabs will prove to be even more convenient. LateNiteSoft product manager Noël Rosenthal notes that the company hopes the resident family tech support person will keep their company’s app in mind when their families upgrade to iOS 18 and then start complaining about “how difficult the new Photos App is to use.” To make the option to switch apps easier on users,Photon Librarywon’t include subscriptions. Instead, the app is a paid download for iPhone and iPad, and starts at $4.99 in the U.S. during its introductory period on the App Store. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Apple’s new macOS Sequoia update is breaking some cybersecurity tools,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,2024-09-19T10:08:11-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/apples-new-macos-sequoia-update-is-breaking-some-cybersecurity-tools/,Security,"Comment On Monday, Apple released itslatest computer operating system update called macOS 15, or Sequoia. And, somehow, the software update has broken the functionality of several security tools made by CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft, and others, according to posts on social media, as well as messages posted in a Mac-focused Slack channel. At this point, it’s unclear exactly what is the issue, but it appears to affect several products made by companies that provide software for macOS users and enterprises, which has caused frustration among people who work on and with macOS-focused security tools. “As a developer of macOS security tools, it’s incredibly frustrating to time and time again have to deal with (understandably) upset users (understandably) blaming your tools for breaking their Macs, when in reality it was Apple’s fault all along,” said Patrick Wardle, the founder of Mac and iOS security startupDoubleYou, and a longtime expert on macOS security. “I get it, that writing bug-free software is challenging, but maybe if Apple spent less time and money on marketing, and more time on actually testing their software, we’d all be better off!” Wardle told TechCrunch. On the day of macOS Sequoia’s release, a CrowdStrike sales engineer said in a Slack room for Mac admins that the company had to delay support for the new version of Mac’s operating system. “I’m very sorry to report that we will not be supporting Sequoia on day 1 in spite of our intention (and previous track record) to support the latest OS within hours of [General Availability],” the engineer said in the message, seen by TechCrunch. The engineer also said CrowdStrike sent out a “Tech Alert” to customers, adding that “there’s quite a lot going on with the changes in the network stack.” ”We’re also tracking some similar issues with other vendors, and have feedback and a case in to Apple. While we would love for there to be a fast-follow patch that resolves this for us, we’re acting under the assumption there won’t be and we’ll need to fix it in our code with a sensor release,” the sales engineer wrote. “Please trust me when I say this was looked at through every angle, to see if there was any way to continue to provide the best protection to our customers on this new OS without having to delay,” the CrowdStrike engineer wrote. “Ultimately it was decided that the best course to protect our Mac fleets is to wait until this is resolved.” Also, several people on Redditreported having issueswith CrowdStrike’s security product on the new macOS. CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch on Thursday that the company is “currently waiting for a macOS Sequoia update and will provide official support. We respectfully refer you to Apple for any additional questions.” Apple did not respond to requests for comment. On Monday, a SentinelOne Support account warned customers in the same Mac-focused Slack channel: “Do not upgrade your endpoints until you have a supported SentinelOne Agent,” citing a series of issues with the new macOS version. SentinelOne did not respond to a request for comment. After publication, SentinelOne spokesperson Craig VerColen said in an email: “SentinelOne delivered full support for macOS Sequoia immediately upon its release this past Monday as covered onour blogand support sites.” ESET alsoalerted customersof a network connection issue after upgrading to macOS Sequoia. An ESET representative did not respond to our request for comment. After publication, ESET spokesperson Jessica Beffa said that ESET products “are compatible with the new macOS.” Other people in the same Slack reported having issues with Microsoft Defender for macOS after the Sequoia update. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. Security researcher Will Dormann wrote on Mastodon that he was having issues withDNSandrunning his firewallon his macOS machine. Another security researcher, Wacław Jacek,wrotein a blog post that, “it seems the OS firewall can sometimes start blocking access to web browsing after upgrading to macOS Sequoia,” and shared a potential workaround. The problems with macOS Sequoia appear to have caused issues with Firefox browser users, too,according to a separate Reddit thread. This story has been updated to include comments from ESET and SentinelOne. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Google rolls out automatic passkey syncing via Password Manager,Kyle Wiggers,2024-09-19T09:59:19-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/google-rolls-out-automatic-passkey-syncing-via-password-manager/,Security,"Comment Passkeys, the digital credentials that let you sign into apps and websites without entering a password, are getting easier to use for Chrome users. You can now save passkeys to Google Password Manager, Google’s password manager built into Chrome on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that your passkeys automatically sync across all your signed-in devices. The Password Manager client on Android can also now automatically sync passkeys, and syncing support for iOS is coming soon. (On ChromeOS, passkey syncing is in beta.) As an added layer of protection, Google is adding PINs to Password Manager. When you start using passkeys on a new device, you’ll need to know either your PIN or the screen lock code for your Android device. You can set up a six-digit PIN or opt for a longer alphanumeric PIN. “These recovery factors will allow you to securely access your saved passkeys and sync new ones across your computers and Android devices,” Chrome product manager Chirag Desai writes in a blog post. Passkey usage is on the rise.Accordingto the FIDO Alliance, the industry organization that develops authentication standards, 53% of people have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts, and passkeys are now supported by 20% of the world’s top 100 websites. In 2023, Googlemadepasskeys the default sign-in method for all users. More recently, the companybroughtpasskey support to its Advanced Protection Program, a program for people at high risk of targeted attacks, like politicians and candidates, ahead of the U.S. presidential election.

Right now, United uses a mix of four in-flight Wi-Fi providers, which each have different capabilities and limitations — this inconsistency isn’t ideal for customers, not to mention, it costs $8.

Back Market lays out its plan to make refurbished phones go mainstream,Romain Dillet,2024-09-19T08:17:55-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/back-market-lays-out-its-plan-to-make-refurbished-phones-mainstream/,Commerce,"Comment Back Marketheld a press conference on Thursday morning in Paris to talk about upcoming product launches and give an update on the company’s current situation. If you’re not familiar with the French startup, it operates a marketplace of refurbished electronics devices — mostly smartphones. It has attracted a lot of investor cash in recent years but has also been through tougher times. In 2021, just like many large tech companies, Back Market rode the wave of zero-interest rate policies around the world and raised an enormous amount of money: a$335 millionSeries D round was followed by another$510 millionSeries E round mere months later. After reaching a valuation of $5.7 billion, Back Market realized that the economy was slowing down. It conducted a small round of layoffsin late 2022, telling French newspaper Les Échos it was “the best way to achieve profitability in the coming years.” Fast-forward to Thursday’spress conferenceand the company was keen to demonstrate its focus is back on product launches and new projects. Back Market said it wants to find new distribution channels and go premium so that more people think about buying a refurbished device instead of a new one. Over the past 10 years, Back Market hasn’t just captured a decent chunk of the secondhand electronics market, it has expanded the market for refurbished smartphones. The pitch is simple: A refurbished device is cheaper than a new one and it’s also better for the planet. Moreover, when it comes to smartphones, it has become much harder to define why this year’s model is better than last year’s — so why shell out lots of money buying new to get only an incremental upgrade? The company doesn’t handle smartphones and other electronic devices directly. Instead, it partners with 1,800 companies that repair and resell old devices. So it’s essentially a specialized services marketplace. Since its inception, it has sold 30 million refurbished devices to 15 million customers. Most Back Market customers buy devices on its website or through its mobile app. But the company has recognized it’s sometimes constrained by its partners’ inventory. This is why it wants to expand supply and demand with strategic partnerships. For instance, it’s partnering with Sony for PlayStation consoles. “A lot of people are coming to Back Market to try and purchase their PlayStation,” said co-founder and CEO Thibaud Hug de Larauze. But the issue is that Back Market is constrained when it comes to supplies for this type of device. While many people think about smartphone trade-ins, most people don’t think about selling their old consoles. “With this partnership with PlayStation by Sony, we are the only partner to trade in every PlayStation within Sony’s website, within the Sony PlayStation store,” he noted. As a result, people buying a new PlayStation get a discount with trade-ins at checkout and Back Market is no longer out of stock for old PlayStation consoles. This is a good example of what Back Market has in mind for future partnerships. “This is one of the first [partnerships of this kind] but we really want to bring it everywhere where customers are actually shopping new. We want to get them where they are, in order to get their old tech — in order to serve it to people who want access to refurbished tech,” Hug de Larauze added. On the smartphone front, trade-ins are already quite popular. However, customers visiting a phone store usually end up buying a new device along with a long-term plan. Back Market is going to partner with telecom companies so that customers can also get a discount on refurbished devices in exchange for a long-term plan. The first two partners for this are Bouygues Telecom in France and Visible, a subsidiary of Verizon Wireless in the U.S. Quality remains the main concern when it comes to buying refurbished devices. In addition to allowing returns, the company is constantly tracking the rate of faulty devices on its platform and trying to bring that number down. Back Market now has a defective rate of 4%, meaning that one in every 25 phones doesn’t work as expected in one way or another. When customers buy a smartphone on Back Market, they can choose between a device in “fair,” “good,” or “excellent” condition. The company has now rolled out a new top tier — called “premium.” The main difference between smartphones with no signs of use and premium refurbished devices is that Back Market certifies that premium devices have been repaired with official parts exclusively. In addition to this new premium tier, Back Market is working on an app update to turn it into a smartphone companion. You can register your smartphone with your Back Market account to receive tips to keep your device in good shape for longer. They are also working on gamification features, including badges and rewards. Similarly, Back Market will make it easier to check the value of your current phone. “You open the Back Market app, you shake your phone and you’ll find out,” chief product officer, Amandine Durr, explained. This feature will launch around Black Friday. Finally, Back Market is going to use generative AI to make it easier to browse the catalog. It can be hard to compare two smartphone models to understand which one is better for you. In a few months, you’ll be able to select two phones and get an AI-generated summary of how the two models compare. When thinking about growth potential, instead of focusing on the smartphone industry, Back Market said it draws inspiration from the car industry. “Nine people out of 10 are purchasing a pre-owned car today,” said Hug de Larauze. “Everything has been created and lined up for that — the availability of spare parts for everyone, you’re not forced to repair your car where you purchased it.” Similarly, repairability is changing for smartphones and spare parts,starting with the European Union. By June 2025, manufacturers will be forced to sell their spare parts to people and companies who want to fix devices themselves. The shift to refurbished devices is also already well underway in Europe. “Back Market is going to be profitable for the first time in Europe in 2024,” said Hug de Larauze. “This is a big milestone for us because when we created the company and until very recently… we had that label that said: ‘OK, this is an impact company.’ Impact means good feelings, but the money is not there. “Well it’s not the case, it’s actually making money,” he added. Now, let’s see if Back Market can become the go-to destination for refurbished devices in more countries, starting with the U.S. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Dcode Capital, Albedo, and Biofire are coming to TechCrunch Disrupt 2024",TechCrunch Events,2024-09-19T08:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/dcode-capital-albedo-and-biofire-are-coming-to-techcrunch-disrupt-2024/,TechCrunch Disrupt 2024,"Comment In a world where innovation knows no borders, a new trend is rising in the tech ecosystem: national-interest startups. From aerospace and defense to critical infrastructure, these firms are ensuring that innovation directly supports national growth, security, and prosperity. As we approach an inflection point in Silicon Valley’s evolution, the question arises: Can startups rebuild the foundations of an entire nation? TechCrunch Disrupt 2024is excited to bring together three distinguished leaders who are making waves in the national-interest startup space. Together, they will share their insights on how new technologies can scale rapidly while serving the strategic interests of their home countries. Rebecca Gevalt is the managing partner atDcode Capital, a venture fund that invests in high-growth technology companies that are poised to revolutionize the U.S. government. With her deep background in both the private and public sectors — including over a decade at the CIA — Rebecca is uniquely positioned to navigate the intersection of government and cutting-edge technology. Her expertise lies in scaling commercial technologies into the federal market, a mission that began with her role at Dcode’s accelerator program and now expands to the broader reach of Dcode Capital. Topher Haddad, co-founder and CEO ofAlbedo, is pioneering the commercialization of very low Earth orbit (VLEO) imagery, which will allow for unprecedented levels of resolution previously limited to government and defense. His company’s upcoming satellite launch is set to disrupt the commercial Earth observation industry, enabling new applications across sectors like defense, agriculture, and utilities. Haddad’s background as an engineer at Lockheed Martin and his technical expertise in national security space programs make him a leader in the race to leverage space for national-interest applications. Kai Kloepfer, founder and CEO ofBiofire, has brought to market the first biometric “smart gun” in the U.S., a feat that many believed impossible. His firearm, equipped with fingerprint and facial recognition, aims to prevent unauthorized access, significantly enhancing safety for users, law enforcement, and even national defense. Kloepfer’s journey from high school inventor to CEO of a venture-backed company speaks to his commitment to innovation in a highly regulated, politically sensitive space.

"UPchieve, an online tutor app for low-income students, launches a free tool for teachers",Lauren Forristal,2024-09-19T08:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/upchieve-online-tutor-app-low-income-students-launches-free-tool-teachers/,Apps,"Comment UPchieve, the free, 24/7 online tutoring and college counseling app for low-income students, announced Thursday it’s giving teachers in Title 1 middle schools and high schools a new tool to ensure their students get the academic support they need. The new offering, called “UPchieve for Teachers,” allows teachers to offer 1:1 support to their students. They can invite students to sign up for tutoring, create classes, and monitor students’ platform usage. Previously, students had to sign up for tutoring services themselves, but with this new product, teachers can now recommend students for 1:1 tutoring at no cost. In the coming weeks, they’ll also be able to assign tutoring sessions to entire classes. UPchieve for Teachers is available to educators working in Title 1 middle schools and high schools. Title 1 is a federal aid program provided to K-12 schools with the highest number of low-income families within school districts. Approximately43%of public schools qualify for Title I funding, with fewer than 50,000 schools benefiting from the program. This new offering is expected to help UPchieve expand its user base by reaching students who may not be aware of free services like this or who may not be actively seeking additional assistance. “The product is going to be really valuable to teachers because it’s going to help them accomplish some of the hardest parts of their job,” founder Aly Murray told TechCrunch. “Students are coming into the class with different gaps in their foundational skills. Teachers have to try to support all of their students, but there’s not enough time to support each student individually, so that’s a natural place where a tutor can help. We’re really excited about launching a product that’s going to give teachers more control.” UPchieve was founded in 2016, shortly after Murray graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. As a former low-income student herself, she struggled to access academic support services throughout her schooling and wanted to make it easy for other students to be able to get help whenever they needed it, even when working on homework late at night. “I was raised by a single mom, and as an immigrant to the United States, she often wasn’t able to help me with schoolwork and with my college applications. And so that had a big impact on my life. It made things very difficult, and I found that I often needed help late at night when there was really nowhere I could turn to for support,” Murray said. UPchieve says it has matched over 190,000 tutoring requests from more than 20,000 students across all 50 states. Its 24/7 online tutoring sessions are conducted in the in-app messenger or via voice chat on the web or mobile app. UPchieve covers over 30 subjects, including math, science, English, history, humanities, and more. Tutors can volunteer by signing up on the website. Volunteers can even be students themselves; however, they must be in 9th grade or higher. UPchieve currently has around 2,400 tutors active on the platform. “All of the volunteers on UPchieve go through a background screening, training, and certification process to become a volunteer tutor. Before they’re ever going to work with a student, they have to pass a quiz in every subject that they want to help students with,” Murray explained. Similar to other edtech companies, the company utilizes OpenAI’s GPT-4o to assist tutors in providing AI-generated feedback and progress reports to students after the sessions are over. In the future, the company also plans to use AI to help tutors create practice problems and offer AI-generated summaries of student sessions through its Teachers product. “We have no plans to replace our human tutors with AI tutors anytime in the near future,” Murray added. As a nonprofit organization, UPchieve relies on charitable donations, grants, and paid partnerships with schools, districts, and corporations. Donors include Atlassian, AT&T, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Guggenheim Capital, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, the Skyline Foundation, and Verizon. UPchieve has partnered with over 50 schools, and each school or organization pays a $10,000 partnership fee per year or is sponsored by a donor or corporation who pays the fee on their behalf.

Amazon releases a video generator — but only for ads,Kyle Wiggers,2024-09-19T07:01:11-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/amazon-releases-a-video-generator-but-only-for-ads/,AI,"Comment Like itsrival, Google, Amazon haslaunchedan AI-powered video generator — but it’s only for advertisers at the moment, and somewhat limited in what it can do. Today at its Accelerate conference, Amazon unveiled Video Generator, which turns a single product image into video showcases of that product after some amount of processing. The company says that the tool can curate “custom,” AI-generated videos that “showcase a product’s features” at no additional cost. “[Videos from Video Generator] leverage Amazon’s unique retail insights to vividly bring a product story to life in ways that are relevant to customers,” Amazon writes in ablog post. In a statement, Amazon Ads VP Jay Richman said that Video Generator, which is currently in beta for select U.S. advertisers (and specifically forSponsored Brands campaigns), will be fine-tuned over the next several months ahead of a wider release. “Video Generator is another meaningful innovation that leverages generative AI to inspire creativity and deliver more value for both advertisers and shoppers,” Richman said. “We are hard at work delivering generative AI applications that empower advertisers to craft visually stunning, high-performing ads.” A related new capability announced today, live image, generates few-seconds-long, animated GIFs from a still frame. Also in limited beta, it’s a part ofImage generator, Amazon’s AI-powered image generation suite for marketers. Amazon didn’t provide sample footage from Video Generator, and it initially revealed very few technical details about the tool and live image. Late this afternoon, an Amazon spokesperson answered a few of TechCrunch’s Video Generator-related questions via email. Clips from Video Generator are 6-9 seconds in length at a 720p resolution (24 frames per second). They’re automatically generated “around” a seed product image — “inspired by the product and its details,” the spokesperson said — and take up to five minutes to create. Users get four variations to choose from. Video Generator outputs seem to follow the same basic formula: Two scenes with headlines (e.g. “Nourishing Lavender Moisturizer”), background music, and a call to action. The font and soundtrack can be customized, as well as the brand logo that appears in the upper-right-hand corner of the frame. Amazon’s expansion into generative video comes as other players release their own video-generating tech. Startups Runway and Lumalaunched generative video APIsthis month, and Googlesays that it’s beginning to integrateits flagship video model, Veo, into YouTube Shorts. Elsewhere, Adobepromisedthat video generation would come to its Creative Suite platform by the end of the year, and OpenAI is expected to roll out its technology,Sora, in some capacity this fall. As with all generative AI systems, there are risks to using these tools. Video-generating models are trained on a vast number of examples of videos to “learn” the patterns in these videos to generate new clips. Some vendors train models on copyrighted videos without obtaining permission from the owners or creators, and, when these models “regurgitate” copyrighted stills, it exposes users of the models to IP lawsuits. Amazon is one of several companies that has said it’ll protect customers accused of violating copyright with media generated by its models, in keeping with its indemnification policy. We’ve asked the company if Video Generator and live image are also covered under that policy. However the legal battles shake out, one thing’s becoming clear: Generative AI threatens to upend the film and television industry as we know it. A 2024studycommissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that by 2026, more than 100,000 U.S.-based entertainment jobs will be disrupted by generative AI.

Tidal Metals sees seawater as the solution to a critical mineral shortage,Tim De Chant,2024-09-19T07:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/tidal-metals-sees-seawater-as-the-solution-to-a-critical-mineral-shortage/,Climate,"Comment Last year, the U.S. designated magnesium as acritical mineral, one of the “electric 18” that are critical for the energy transition. The metal is used in a range of electronics, and it weighs less than aluminum, making it an attractive alternative for automakers. But like with so many other minerals, China has grown to dominate the market. It’s not because magnesium is scarce — in fact, it’s the eighth most abundant mineral in the Earth’s crust, and it’s the third most abundant dissolved mineral in the world’s oceans. But in the U.S., at least, only one company produces virgin metal — everything else is either imported or recycled from scrap. “The name of the game really is, can you compete with the 90% production that’s coming out of China today?” said Howard Yuh, co-founder and CEO ofTidal Metals. Yuh is betting that his startup can. The company, previously known as GreenBlu, had been working on desalination technology when it realized there was more value in the minerals that were left behind. “At that time, the industry around magnesium was already sort of in shambles in the United States,” he said. Sensing opportunity, in late 2023 the company pivoted to magnesium production and rebranded. The lightweight metal has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from transportation if it can be produced with minimal pollution. Motorsports fans will note that magnesium is common in race cars, particularly in the wheels, where every pound lost improves acceleration and handling. In passenger vehicles, broader use of magnesium would improve fuel economy, reducing the carbon footprint of fossil fuel vehicles and extending the range of electric vehicles. Some battery companies have begun to explore using the metal to improve energy density. Magnesium today is largely produced in two ways: by cooking the mineral dolomite and by evaporating salt water, usually in giant open-air ponds, and processing what remains. The former is widely used in China and dominates production; it’s also incredibly polluting, especially when coal is the heat source. Tidal Metals follows the latter, the evaporative approach, but it eschews the ponds. In its place, it uses what’s known as a temperature-swing vapor pump. Basically, the company uses a material that readily absorbs moisture to evaporate seawater or brines leftover from desalination. The material is similar to the silica gel packets you find tucked in things made overseas, and it sits inside a box that’s exposed to seawater. When the material becomes saturated, Tidal Metals closes the box and raises the temperature, releasing the water. Meanwhile, another material-filled box opens to continue evaporating the seawater. Once that box is saturated, Tidal Metals uses heat pumps to move the heat from the first box, which is now drier, to the second, saturated box. Apart from the initial heat needed to warm the first box, Yuh said the process is very efficient. “We’ve basically recycled about 97% of the energy.” In the end, the startup will have evaporated a metric ton of seawater to produce about 4 kilograms of the magnesium salt. Once the water is evaporated, some H2O molecules are still bound to the magnesium chloride. Those need to go, too. Yuh wouldn’t disclose details, but he said the company has tweaked an existing process to make it easier. Tidal Metals is working on a pilot plant that can produce 200 tons per year. Funding for the project comes from a recent $8.5 million seed round led by DCVC with participation from Bidra Innovation Ventures and First Spark Ventures. Once the engineering on that plant is sorted, Yuh said the startup is aiming for a larger-scale facility that can produce 10,000 tons per year, possibly as early as 2026. Altogether, Tidal Metals’ process promises to be significantly less polluting than what’s done in China, particularly if renewable electricity is used to power the heat pumps. Plus, because the company can use seawater and briny waste from desalination plants, the resource is nearly unlimited, unlike magnesium that comes from mined dolomite. “The one desalination plant in San Diego pumps in 100 million gallons of seawater a day. That’s enough to supply all of the U.S. with magnesium — 180,000 tons a year,” Yuh said. “Today, it’s all going to waste.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Amazon debuts Project Amelia, an AI assistant for sellers",Sarah Perez,2024-09-19T06:53:35-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/amazon-debuts-an-ai-assistant-for-sellers-project-amelia/,Commerce,"Comment Amazon sellers now have access to an AI assistant designed to help grow their business by answering questions about their metrics, and later, helping to resolve issues that arise. The assistant, code-named Project Amelia and built on AWS’sAmazon Bedrock, is available in beta to U.S. sellers, starting Thursday. The retail giant says select U.S. sellers will gain access immediately, followed by a broader rollout across the U.S. Later this year, the feature will begin to arrive in more countries and in other languages besides English. The goal with Project Amelia, explains Amazon, is to offer sellers tools that can then manage and grow their business. At launch, sellers will be able to retrieve information like sales data and customer traffic information, and be able to ask the assistant questions like “How is my business doing?” In response, the AI will offer a summary of metrics, including recent sales, units sold, and website traffic, comparing those metrics to the same time last year. Sellers will also be able to ask follow-up questions, like those focused on a single product’s sale, growth, and customer traffic, among other things. Later, the AI assistant will be able to help resolve issues and aid with other tasks. For example, Amazon sellers will be able to ask something like “I have 300 units on the way and don’t see that reflected in the report. Can someone look into this?” and they’ll receive personalized guidance. If needed, they may also be connected with Amazon’s support team to help them investigate the issue further, which makes the assistant sound more like a traditional chatbot, in that case. Further down the road, Project Amelia will be able to offer sellers “additional help managing the task” or may even “offer to solve the problem on a seller’s behalf,” Amazon says, without providing specifics or a time frame to launch. “We are always seeking to equip our selling partners with the most effective tools and capabilities, empowering them to more easily start and grow a successful business,” readsa blog post, penned by Mary Beth Westmoreland, VP of Amazon’s Worldwide Selling Partner Experience. “By leveraging the transformative power of generative AI, we are creating and deploying technologies that will improve how sellers can manage and grow their businesses. Innovative solutions like Project Amelia are reducing the time, effort, and resources required from sellers to manage their business, allowing them more time for building great products and delighting customers,” she adds. Amelia’s launch follows the launch of another AI chatbot aimed at consumers,Rufus, which went live in the U.S. this summer. On the consumer side, Amazon is also leveraging AI to help customersfind clothes that fitand toenhance product reviews, among other things. For sellers, Amazon had previously introduced generativeAI tools to help them create product listings, and for those who advertise on Amazon, tools togenerate backgrounds using AI. On Thursday, Amazon also shared how it was usinggenerative AI to improve its product recommendationsfor consumers as well as its product descriptions. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Zeno emerges from stealth to crib Tesla’s master plan for Africa and beyond,Tim De Chant,2024-09-19T06:30:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/zeno-emerges-from-stealth-to-crib-teslas-master-plan-for-africa-and-beyond/,Climate,"Comment When Elon Musk published Tesla’s first“master plan”in 2006, it seemed a bit far-fetched that batteries would end up changing the automotive industry, much less global power production and consumption. Today, as electric vehicles continue to gain market share and massive batteries displace smoke-spewing power plants from the electrical grid, that notion seems less improbable. This year in the U.S. alone, developers are planning to add15 gigawattsof grid-scale battery capacity. Yet Michael Spencer thinks that the shift that’s occurring in places like the U.S., Europe, and China is just the beginning. “The Tesla master plan has more legs and more room to run with lower hurdles in emerging markets,” he told TechCrunch. To prove the point, Spencer, a Tesla alumnus, foundedZenoin 2022. The startup, which until now has operated in stealth, has been methodically exploring how batteries might transform life in emerging markets, beginning in East Africa. The company has attracted considerable talent, including Swaroop Bhushan, who helped design Lucid’s powertrain; Rob Newberry, who helped oversee development of Apple’s AirPort and Apple TV; and others from Gogoro, Tesla and more. Zeno’s first product is a motorbike with a swappable battery. But in Spencer’s vision, that’s just the start. Swappable batteries won’t just be powering motorbikes in Africa, but other parts of people’s lives as well. Motorbike taxis, known asbodaboda, are ubiquitous in East African cities, helping people navigate choking gridlock for far less money than a taxi or personal car. For drivers, though, the costs can be astronomical. Motorbike taxi drivers spend a disproportionate amount of their income on fuel, about 50% compared with afew percentfor commuters in California, Spencer points out. Taking a cue from Taiwanese-startupGogoro, which helped pioneer the battery swap concept in scooters, entrepreneurs throughout Africa put their own spin on it. The bikes are sold with holes in their chassis where drivers plug in rented batteries. When the packs are near empty, drivers can find a nearby location to exchange it for a fully charged one. As a result, swap stations from startups like Ampersand Solar, Arc Ride,Roam, Spiro, andZembohave sprouted like grass after a monsoon rain. Zeno is the latest entrant to the field. The company started by testing around 40 Chinese-made electric motorbikes in various models in Kenya to see how they’d fare. It only took a couple months before the bikes were trashed — they simply weren’t designed for taxi duty on East Africa’s harsh roads — but Spencer said the experience validated his thesis. It also turned up something else. “There were lots of questions around, like, ‘Why can’t I use this battery for other things?’” Spencer recalled. “We saw some people trying to hack batteries when the power went out, to try to run the lights or to run the flour mill in their shop.” The Zeno team knew they’d need more durable, heavier bikes that could carry a driver, a passenger or two, and possibly some cargo. It’s working with a manufacturer in India to produce bikes to its specifications, and soon after that model launches, additional manufacturers will release their own two-, three-, and light four-wheel vehicles that will be compatible with the startup’s batteries, Spencer said. Bigger bikes demand more power, which means they need bigger batteries. Zeno’s lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery packs store 2 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and its motorbike will accept two packs. With one midday swap, that will give the bike slightly more range than most taxi drivers need in a day, Spencer said. The extra capacity “opens up all these other doors.” Spencer and his colleagues started building docks so people could use the motorbikes’ spare power to charge phones and run various appliances. “We prototyped an induction cook stove that ran off of our swappable motorcycle battery and got a pretty cool little microcosm,” Spencer said. Motorbike taxi drivers could drive home after a day of work, hook their batteries up to the stove to cook dinner and then breakfast the next morning. At that point they would have 10 to 15% charge left, which is enough to drive back to town to swap for a full battery at a self-service station. Every part of the system will have internet connectivity so the company can monitor the batteries, anticipate demand, and facilitate financing. The bikes use a Type 6 connector so that drivers can plug into public chargers during a lunch break, for example, or charge overnight at home if the need arises. The company is also building a charging network that will be available to non-Zeno drivers. Zeno’s first motorbikes will hit roads in East Africa and India in early 2025. Customers will have to buy or lease the vehicle, which will cost less than a new gasoline-powered model when configured without a battery. The startup will lease the batteries under a subscription model (though people can also buy the battery outright if they choose). Customers can add energy to the subscription bundle or buy it separately on a pay-per-use model. Zeno’s goal is to undercut gas-powered bikes with the upfront cost of a bike and initial battery subscription. And because the power costs of electric motorbikes are about half that of a gas model’s fuel bill, Spencer said the savings improve over time. Shortly after the bike launches, the company plans to release its home battery dock with an available solar panel, which Spencer hopes will open new markets. “If you don’t have grid connectivity, you can bring your batteries home from a swap station, and you can use them to power your home. If you want to put solar on your house, that home docking station works as a solar inverter to charge those batteries. So you can be a Zeno battery subscriber for a decade and never swap batteries.” To fund its launch and expansion, the company recently raised an oversubscribed $9.5 million seed round led by Lowercarbon Capital and Toyota Ventures with participation from 4DX Ventures, Active Impact, Advantedge, MCJ, and RedBlue. Zeno’s playbook certainly has echoes of Tesla’s, offering customers electrified transportation with a lower cost of ownership. But by focusing on a portable battery, Zeno is selling the ability to use energy whenever, something more akin to how people use fossil fuels today. The motorbike is a central part of the sales pitch, but the battery might be the real selling point. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Kiwibot acquires an ad startup to turn its delivery robots into mobile billboards,Brian Heater,2024-09-19T06:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/kiwibot-acquires-ad-startup-to-turn-its-delivery-robots-into-mobile-billboards/,Robotics,"Comment From the standpoint of any advertising executive,Kiwibothas left a lot of money on the table since its robots began making food deliveries on the UC Berkeley campus back in 2017. After all,the semi-autonomous wheeled systems tend to traverse high-traffic areas. In 2024, they can still draw a crowd of curious onlookers. However you ultimately feel about advertising, you can’t deny that there’s ample opportunity in the form of a mobile billboard. Kiwibot is so convinced of this fact that it plunked down $25 million to purchaseNickelytics. Founded in 2019, the Tampa-based firm specializes in car-wrap advertising. It has since branched out into truck advertising, as well as digital ads through displays like the tablets found in the backseat of ridesharing cars. In March, the company partnered with Kiwi competitor Starship to bring wrapper ads to robots designated for the University of Utah and UCLA. That pilot program launched with the “Love, Your Mind” campaign from Huntsman Mental Health Institute and the Ad Council. Clearly Kiwi liked what it saw. The robotics firm is particularly interested in Nickelytics’ data analytics. That, combined with Kiwibot’s route mapping, offers advertisers an opportunity to spread the word in high-traffic spots spread out across more than 20 states. As part of the deal, Nickelytics CEO Judah Longgrear will join Kiwibot as a co-founder. The ad firm currently has a number of high-profile customers, including  AWS, Coinbase, Nationwide, and DirectTV. Those clients, in turn, will have access to more than 500 mobile Kiwibots. “This acquisition is all about strategically positioning ourselves as a market leader and elevating our offering with Nickelytics’ added approach,” Kiwibots CEO Felipe Chavez said of the deal. “By integrating our technologies and scaling our operations, we’re laying the groundwork for global expansion and continued innovation that will bring a new edge to advertising.” Nickelytics, a 2020 Techstars grad, recently made an acquisition of its own, purchasing Miami print shop Signs Printing Solutions.

AI notetaker Fathom raises $17M,Frederic Lardinois,2024-09-19T06:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/ai-notetaker-fathom-raises-17m/,Enterprise,"Comment In many meetings today, it sometimes feels like there are more AI notetaking and transcription bots than people. There are seemingly dozens of options to choose from these days, but one I’ve seen with increasing regularity isFathom. The company was one of the earlier players when it launched in 2020. Fathom then raised a $4.7 million seed round in early 2022 and, today, the company announced its $17 million Series A round, led by Telescope partners. Notably, $2 million of the $17 million came from Fathom users via crowdfunding on Wefunder. The company says its revenue increased by 90x and usage by 20x over the last two years. That was likely from a relatively low baseline, but while the company didn’t share exact active user numbers, Fathom, which offers agenerous free plan, did say that more than 8,500 companies now use its HubSpot integration. “We always built Fathom around the expectation that AI would get really good,” the company’s CEO and co-founder Richard White told me. “When we started in 2020, AI wasn’t there yet. But we were like: Hey, we’re going to really focus on the things that we think are hard, which is getting distribution, building a really reliable infrastructure, and an easy-to-use product, with this expectation that when AI gets there, we’ll be able to drop that into this already widely distributed easy-to-use product, and it’ll just make it go from good to great.” One thing that always made Fathom stand out is that the company relies on its own models — or at least its own fine-tuned versions of open models. Fathom has its own team working and experimenting with models — and as White noted, working with models is very different from typical engineering projects. “Their output is not a feature, it’s actually spec,” he said about this team. “And it has a failure rate. It’s not like engineering, where you put something on the roadmap, it gets done. It’s like 50% time right now. If it’s not good enough, let’s check back in six months. I think it required rethinking the product development process a little bit.” Over time, the team added a number of new features, including automatically creating action items and drafts for follow-up emails, as well as the “Ask Fathom” chatbot and more features geared towards teams. Most of these more advanced features are gated behind its paid plans, which start at $19/month on its monthly plans. While most of the large meeting services are starting to offer their own takes on what Fathom is doing, White doesn’t seem to be too worried about that. “Our vision is that we want to get all of your meetings in one place,” he said. That broader vision, he said, includes becoming the central source of intelligence for a company’s leadership, something that’s hard to do when you only support a single meeting platform. Part of this vision — and something the new funding round will help Fathom to work on — is to not just help its users with meeting notes and action items, but also with a lot more of the busy work that follows a meeting. It’s starting down this path with its automated action items and follow-up email features, but the idea here is to build more integrations and use AI agents to perform more of these tasks and directly interface with CRM systems, for example. White also noted that there is a lot of data in meetings that isn’t currently being used and that may provide more ambient intelligence to leadership teams over time. Nobody can sit in on every meeting, after all, but White envisions a more proactive system that can alert decision-makers when a sales team, for example, is confronted with a question that they don’t have a good answer for, or when the name of a competitor suddenly becomes more prevalent in meetings. I’ve taken Fathom for a spin in a few meetings this week and have generally been impressed by the quality of its transcriptions but especially by its meeting summaries. Where some other tools (looking at you, Otter) seem to try to shoehorn every meeting into a somewhat rigid flow that seems to be mostly geared toward users in sales, Fathom simply presents a useful summary that smartly creates chapters for every meeting — and you get the option to tell it what kind of meeting it was (one-on-one, Q&A, demo, sales meeting, etc.) and it will tune its summary accordingly. Below is a screenshot of the summary of my interview with Fathom for your viewing pleasure. Powered byWordPress VIP"

Karman Industries hopes its SpaceX-inspired heat pumps will replace industrial boilers,Tim De Chant,2024-09-19T05:30:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/karman-industries-hopes-its-spacex-inspired-heat-pumps-will-replace-industrial-boilers/,Climate,"Comment Industrial heat, which is used by companies as diverse as breweries and food processors to chemical manufacturers and paper mills, is one of the last bastions of fossil fuels. After all, it’s pretty hard to beat a flame when you need to heat something up. But recently, a slew of startups have started exploring ways to make heat using electricity. Some, like Rondo, Antora, andFourth Power, rely on cheap wind and solar to heat specialized bricks to thousands of degrees, storing the thermal energy for later use. Others, like Skyven Technologies, have developed industrial-scale heat pumps that use a series of compressors to achieve the desired temperature. Heat pumps are particularly suited to supplying the not-quite-searing heat used by food and beverage manufacturers. New Belgium Brewing, for example, agreed last year toinstalla 650-kilowatt heat pump boiler from AtmosZero at its Colorado headquarters. That’s exactly the sort of installation targeted byKarman Industries, a heat pump startup that until now had operated in stealth. To replace industrial boilers, the company draws inspiration from SpaceX’s rockets, co-founder and CEO David Tearse told TechCrunch. “On the technology side, what we’re building is much more akin to a Raptor engine in terms of speed, pressure, and temperature,” he said. Like other heat pumps, Karman uses compressors to transfer heat. But unlike the refrigerator in your kitchen, which uses a more prosaic compressor, Karman will use turbomachinery to get the job done. Turbomachinery, which can spin at incredible speeds, is widely used in rockets to pump fuel. Turbomachinery isn’t yet common in heat pumps, though another startup,Evari, is developing one for use in homes and electric vehicles. Inside a heat pump, the turbomachinery’s speed helps minimize the device’s footprint, moving the same amount of heat as typical compressors, but in a smaller package. Karman’s largest compressor will fit in a frame up to eight feet long and six feet in diameter. Smaller models will be about four to five feet long and two to three feet in diameter. None of them will require oil, a necessity for most other heat pumps, which simplifies the design and maintenance. Heat pumps can typically only “lift” the temperature so much. So to get to the sorts of temperatures required by industrial users, even those needing only low-grade heat — up to 150 degrees Celsius — heat pump manufacturers generally string a series of compressors together, each lifting the heat a portion of the total. Each additional compressor adds cost and complexity. “Compared to other systems that are out there, to do the same amount of lift that would take them about five or six stages, we can do in one or two,” Tearse said. Karman already has some experience in industrial heat courtesy of co-founder and CTO Chiranjeev (CJ) Kalra, who was formerly head of technology at Antora and vice president of power generation at Heliogen. Tearse previously worked at aviation startup Skyryse and Riot Ventures, where Karman was incubated. Riot led a $4 million pre-seed investment in Karman with participation from Space VC, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Though it’s still early for the company, Tearse said that he’s confident that the company’s first model, Thermal01, will be cost competitive with natural gas in certain regions and for certain processes. He anticipates a pilot will be ready to install on a customer site in the first half of 2026. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"EU to tell Apple how to do interoperability, DMA style",Natasha Lomas,2024-09-19T05:20:40-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/eu-to-tell-apple-how-to-do-interoperability-dma-style/,Government & Policy,"Comment The European Union has opened two “specification proceedings” on Apple under the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) that will see it instructing the iPhone maker on how to comply with certain interoperability provisions in the market fairness regulation. If Apple fails to meet the Commission’s requirements it could risk fines of up to 10% of its global annual turnover. The European Commission, which enforces the DMA on Apple and the other six gatekeepers in scope of the pan-EU regulation, opened its first non-compliance proceeding on Appleback in March, probing a range of concerns. Reporting preliminary findingsin June, the bloc said it suspected Apple had breached the rulebook in relation to how it operates its App Store. But the wider investigation continues. The tech giant has made a number of changes to its DMA compliance plan both before and since the Commission’s preliminary breach finding. But the EU looks set to dial up its intervention on Apple in relation to interoperability-related changes. This is one of the areas where criticism of Apple’s approach to the DMA has, broadly speaking, been loud, with — for example —concerns raised over the information screens it displays to iOS userswhen they are poised to move away from using Apple’s technologies and adopt alternatives techs for particular functions. The EU also recently concluded a long-running antitrust investigation of Apple’s contactless payment tech where itaccepted binding commitments from the companyto ensure interoperability for developers of rival wallet tech. So the Commission may be hoping to draw on what it has learned from that case to clarify related areas of Apple’s DMA compliance. While the regulation already includes a list of dos and don’ts that the EU expects gatekeepers to follow, there can still be scope for interpretation over exactly how the specific rules apply in particular contexts. So the law also contains powers letting the Commission spell out compliance when it has an open proceeding on a gatekeeper — as is the case with Apple. Specifically, with these two latest proceedings, the bloc will be telling Apple how to provide interoperability to connected devices seeking to tap into iOS’s connectivity features, such as in areas like notifications and device pairing. It also plans to instruct it on how to handle interoperability requests from app developers building software for its mobile and tablet platforms iOS and iPadOS — both of which are regulated as so-called “core platform services” under the DMA. “The first proceeding focuses on several iOS connectivity features and functionalities, predominantly used for and by connected devices,” the Commission wrote in apress release. “Connected devices are a varied, large and commercially important group of products, including smartwatches, headphones and virtual reality headsets. Companies offering these products depend on effective interoperability with smartphones and their operating systems, such as iOS. The Commission intends to specify how Apple will provide effective interoperability with functionalities such as notifications, device pairing and connectivity.” “The second proceeding focuses on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requestssubmitted by developers and third parties for iOS and iPadOS. It is crucial that the request process is transparent, timely, and fair so that all developers have an effective and predictable path to interoperability and are enabled to innovate,” the Commission added. Reached for comment, Apple spokesman Julien Trosdorf emailed a statement in which the company wrote: “At Apple, we’re proud of the fact that we’ve built over 250,000 APIs that allow developers to build apps that access our operating system and functionalities in a way that ensures users’ privacy and security. To comply with the DMA, we’ve also created ways for apps in the European Union to request additional interoperability with iOS and iPadOS while protecting our users. Undermining the protections we’ve built over time would put European consumers at risk, giving bad actors more ways to access their devices and data. We will continue to work constructively with the European Commission on a path forward that both protects our EU users and clarifies the regulation.” The Commission has six months to conclude this pair of proceedings after which it says it will send preliminary findings to Apple explaining the measures it is expected to take to “effectively comply” with the DMA’s interoperability obligation. A summary of the EU’s findings will also be made public at that time. The two new DMA proceedings on Apple do not imply the Commission has reached the end of the wider non-compliance proceeding still open on the company. So Apple could still face a DMA enforcement decision (and potential fine) down the line. However, the EU is clearly looking for quick results for its flagship market contestability regulation. For that reason, the Commission is likely to be most keenly focused on finding ways to apply the new toolbox so the DMA can work at pace to reshape Apple’s compliance instead of landing a hefty penalty. But, clearly, having a big stick to encourage compliance helps. The early opening of a DMA proceeding on Apple has helped the Commission dial up its interventions as it unlocked access to certain powers — such as these specification proceedings. We have also already seen quite a lot of movement from Apple over its DMA offer. Changes the tech giant made to its original compliance proposal under Commission scrutiny includeopening up web distribution for iOS appsand applying fewer restrictions onhow developers can link out to cheaper offers outside the App Store, as well astweaks to browser choice screens,among other revisions. On the flip side, it has introduced araftofnew fees— andcritics continue to complainits changes still haven’t gone far enough. So where all this ends up is still a moveable feast.

This founder grew up in wine country — now he’s built a platform for wine makers,Mike Butcher,2024-09-19T05:14:24-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/this-founder-grew-up-in-wine-country-nows-hes-built-a-platform-for-wine-makers/,Enterprise,"Comment Growing up in theHunter Valley, a region of Australia renowned for its fine wine production,Mitchel Fowlernever realized he might one day think of an idea that could revolutionize the wine industry. Now, after a long career in finance, he has returned to that heritage to launch a platform to solve the wine industry’s long-running procurement cycle and inventory management problems. Ferovinumis both a SaaS platform and a lending platform for wine producers. Wine makers have a problem using conventional B2B lending or banking products, since their inventory can’t be easily lent against. So, Ferovinum turns the wine and spirits produced into a “just-in-time asset” so that producers can focus their capital on growth instead of tying it up in stock, and scale up funding for their production in a way that would be riskier if they used conventional financial products. Ferovinum’s customers place their inventories on the platform during their production and distribution periods, and then sell them on to resellers. As Fowler told TechCrunch over a call: “Since the platform carries the stock for the clients end-to-end — throughout the entire value chain — this allows the client’s supply chain to benefit from our supply chain technology, automation, and market access for import and export flows. Thus getting closer to, for instance, exports to the U.S.” Fowler says the platform can “democratize” financing even for smaller producers. The company has now raised $23.2 million (£17.5 million) for global expansion. It claims it has provided £114 million in working capital for the U.K. wine and spirits industry as a result of customers using its platform. Ferovinum is also tackling a market where there is little direct competition. Wine and drinks producers often only cobble together various software to run their businesses, and the financing aspect remains separate. “There are SaaS tools, likeUnleashed, for example, which is wine inventory management software. But the beauty of what we’re building is, it’s end-to-end and sector-specific. So from managing it in the warehouse all the way to delivering and fulfilling to those retailers,” Fowler said. That’s what attractedNotion Capital, a European SaaS and cloud investment firm, whose general partner Jos White will now join Ferovinum’s board. The round also saw participation fromShaper Capital, Semapa Next and Ferovinum’s existing shareholder group. The startup’s customers now include two of Edinburgh’s independent distilleries (Holyrood Distillery and Port of Leith Distillery), as well as English sparkling wine producers Ridgeview Wine Estate and Hundred Hills Winery.

"Picus Security, founded by 3 Turkish mathematicians, raises $45M after simulating 1B cyberattacks",Ingrid Lunden,2024-09-19T05:02:42-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/picus-security-founded-by-turkish-3-mathematicians-raises-45m-after-simulating-1b-cyberattacks/,Security,"Comment For as long as programming has existed, we have had a plethora of methods to ensure the code works as intended. These days, that entire testing process has been kicked into high gear: The growing sophistication of security breaches has turned software verification into a much more urgent task — and a far more complicated one. “Everyone has a different, evolving approach,” said Alper Memis, the CEO ofPicus Security. “The holy grail is creating a connection between them.” If understanding what the holy grail looks like is half the challenge of finding it, Picus believes it’s well on the way toeternal happiness. The startup’s platform runs continuous validation processes to root out and fix inconsistencies in code and other network activity. Now, after picking up more than 500 enterprise customers and simulating some 1 billion cyberattacks for the likes of Mastercard, Visa, Vodafone and the banking giant ING, it has raised $45 million in a Series C round to expand its business. Riverwood Capital, a prolific enterprise investor, is leading the investment. Previous backer Earlybird Digital East Fund is also participating. Picus has now raised $80 million to date, and while it is not disclosing its valuation, in 2022, when it last raised funding from investors (a round that included Mastercard), it was valued at a modest $94 million post-money, according toPitchBook data. Since then, the company has grown to 200 employees and tripled its revenues, with key markets in the Americas leading the way. For more guidance, a competitor of Picus’ called Cymulate was most recently valued at$440 million. Memis, pictured above, came up with the idea for Picus Security with Volkan Ertürk (its CTO) and Dr. Süleyman Özarslan (the VP of Picus’ research arm, Picus Labs). The three have been friends since they were studying mathematics in university, and the academic work took them each in different directions. Memis doubled down on business and finance; Ertürk parlayed his mathematical leanings into cyber defense; and Özarslan became an academic. They all stayed in touch, and one day in 2013 they got to talking. “We liked to exchange ideas about what might be the next big thing,” Memis said. Ertürk recounted how he was advising on a huge cyber project that appeared to be configured correctly, yet only a month later, the organization got breached. Özarslan suggested that the only way to really help defend a non-static system was to test all the time: The constant shipping of code and data just changed the parameters too often otherwise. Here is where Memis’ expertise also kicked in: The world of finance continually runs simulations to determine what the outcomes for any action might be. Picus, the company they founded, turned out to be one of the first in the field to focus on the idea of continuous validation and simulation testing. That they were in Turkey and starting as early as 2013, however, meant that the startup was swimming against the tide — cybersecurity wasn’t as big as it is today. Outside funding did not come fast, and Picus was bootstrapped for the first five years of its life as it worked on the best way to scale and automate its technology and prove its idea to the market. Picus eventually relocated to San Francisco, and as security became a bigger nightmare for organizations, its ideas caught on. One of Picus’ unique selling points is that it is built to work with the fragmentation that is part and parcel of the enterprise IT market these days. The company says it has integrations with some 80 other major security partners, which funnel alerts and other activity into Picus’ platform. Its solution incorporates automated penetration testing, breach and attack simulation, and rule validation checks across the various silos in order to investigate activity both within specific tools, and so to have a better understanding of how activity in one silo might be related to something happening elsewhere. Security teams can observe all of this on a single dashboard. Accepting that there will be proprietary systems and tools on a network but taking an open approach to interacting with them is what caught the eye of investors. “By taking a fresh, open approach to continuous threat exposure management, Picus’ platform empowers organizations to better understand their cyber risks and be proactive against bad actors,” Joe De Pinho, partner at Riverwood Capital, said in a statement. “Their use of automated pen-testing alongside continuous validation is not only a game-changer today, but also lays the groundwork for how enterprises will safeguard themselves in the future.” De Pinho is taking a board seat with this round.

Brightband sees a bright (and open source) future for AI-powered weather forecasting,Devin Coldewey,2024-09-19T04:31:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/brightband-sees-a-bright-and-open-source-future-for-ai-powered-weather-forecasting/,AI,"Comment With an explosion of weather and climate data that the last generation of tools can’t handle, is AI the future of forecasting? Research certainly suggests so, and a newly funded startup calledBrightbandis taking a shot at turning machine learning forecast models into both a business and open source standard. Today’s weather prediction and climate monitoring techniques are rooted in statistical and numerical models that are going on decades old. That doesn’t mean they’re bad or wrong — just not particularly efficient. These physics-based models are the kind of thing you set aside a few weeks on a supercomputer for. But AI has a knack for pulling patterns out of large bodies of data, and research has shown that, when AI is trained on years of weather patterns and observations around the world, it can predict upcoming events with surprising accuracy. So why isn’t it being used all over the place? “The reason there’s this gap is that the government finds it hard to attract top talent, as do weather companies, while for these tech companies, weather is not their core industry. They don’t go deep into the domain and work with the players to give them the tools they need,” explained Julian Green, CEO and co-founder of Brightband (formerly known as OpenEarthAI). “We think a startup brings great AI people, great data people, and great weather people together. There’s a real opportunity to operationalize AI and make it available to everyone.” The startup is in the process of designing its own model trained on years of weather observation data, but Daniel Rothenberg, co-founder and head of data and weather, was quick to note that they’re “standing on the shoulders of giants.” “The big physics-based models are monsters,” he said. “But AI is the beneficiary of those models — the first leap was taking advantage of them, finding that the models really can learn those patterns. We’re building on top of that and extending it. We’re shooting for state of the art: as good or better than the available global weather forecasting.” It would also be orders of magnitude faster, Green noted. “That’s sort of the core disruption: it’s faster and cheaper,” making it more suitable to custom and fast-moving use cases. “People have very specific needs across different industries,” Green went on. “Energy companies need to be able to predict the supply of renewables from wind and sun, and demand for heating and cooling; transportation companies need to avoid extreme weather; agriculture needs to plan weeks out to hire people to seed, water, fertilize, or harvest.” Interestingly, the company is committing toreleasing its models for anyone to use. “Our goal is to open source the basic forecasting capability, not just the model but the data you use to train it, and the metrics you use to evaluate it; business model is to layer on top, paid-for services for more specific capabilities,” Green said. Part of doing so means including (and processing, and releasing) lots of data that has been skipped over in favor of pre-processed databases. “There’s petabytes upon petabytes of historical data from weather balloons and satellites that are ignored because they’re hard to work with,” said Rothenberg; but as with most AI models, the more data the better, and a carefully curated variety can significantly improve the quality of their output. “We really feel that building a community around this is going to accelerate the things we can do in terms of understanding the atmosphere and doing it at scale.” I suggested that this seemed almost like they were doing what the National Weather Service (which provides tons of observational data and forecasts for free as a public service) and other agencies would do if they could. Green demurred, saying they work closely with those agencies and that they are indeed the keepers of a trove of important data — it just isn’t necessarily the kind of fast, portable data that a highly responsive consumer-facing company needs. He said they see this as a continuation of the international collaboration on weather data. As for where they actually are in building the product: “It’s relatively early,” Green admitted. “We’ve been working on this for a few months, nothing is live today but we hope to have a model by the end of 2024 that takes in observations [i.e. satellite or local radar imagery] and produces a forecast for them.” Brightband is structured as a public benefit corporation, but that’s “primarily signaling,” Green said. “We’re trying to lay out our mission transparently, pinning our cause to the mast and saying ‘this is what we’re interested in doing.’ I think the 10 million we raised is testament to the fact that we’re able to attract capital.” A PBC in this case basically means the board has to balance shareholder interests with those of the stated mission in certain circumstances, but doesn’t limit profits or anything like that. Expect a weather-related product before a climate one — but neither has a hard timeline except for the end-of-year show-and-tell. Brightband’s $10 million Series A round was led by Prelude Ventures, with participation from Starshot Capital, Garage Capital, Future Back Ventures, Preston-Werner Ventures, CLAI Ventures, Adrien Treuille, and Cal Henderson.

AI governance can’t be left to the vested interests,Natasha Lomas,2024-09-19T04:21:25-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/ai-governance-cant-be-left-to-the-vested-interests/,Government & Policy,"Comment Afinal reportby the UN’s high-level advisory body on artificial intelligence makes for, at times, a surreal read. Named “Governing AI for Humanity,” the document underlines the contradictory challenges of making any kind of governance stick on such a fast developing, massively invested and heavily hyped technology. On the one hand, the report observes — quite correctly — that there’s “a global governance deficit with respect to AI.” On the other, the UN advisory body dryly points out that: “Hundreds of [AI] guides, frameworks and principles have been adopted by governments, companies and consortiums, and regional and international organizations.” Even as this report adds plus-one-more set of recommendations to the AI governance pile. The overarching problem the report is highlighting is there’s a patchwork of approaches building up around governing AI, rather than any collective coherence on what to do about a technology that’s both powerful and stupid. AI automation can certainly be powerful: Press the button and you get outputs scaled on demand. But AI can also be stupid because, despite what the name implies, AI is not intelligence; its outputs are a reflection of its inputs; and bad inputs can lead to very bad (and unintelligent) outcomes. Add scale to stupidity and AI can cause very big problems indeed, as the report highlights. For instance, it can amplify discrimination or spread disinformation. Both of which are already happening, in all sorts of domains, at problematic scale, which leads to very real-world harms. But those with commercial irons in the generative AI fire that’s been raging over the past few years are so in thrall to the potential scale upside of this technology that they’re doing everything they can to downplay the risks of AI stupidity. In recent years, this has included heavy lobbying about the idea that the world needs rules to protect against so-called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or the concept of an AI that can think for itself and could even out-think humans. But this is a flashy fiction intended to grab policymakers’ attention and focus lawmakers’ minds on nonexistent AI problems, thereby normalizing the harmful stupidities of current gen AI tools. (So really, the PR game being played is about defining and defusing the notion of concept of “AI Safety” by making it mean let’s just worry about science fiction.) A narrow definition of AI safety serves to distract from the vast environmental harms of pouring ever more compute power, energy, and water into building data centers big enough to feed this voracious new beast of scale. Debates aboutwhether we can afford to keep scaling AI like thisare not happening at any high level — but maybe they should be? The ushered-in spector of AGI also serves to direct the conversation to skip over the myriad legal and ethical issues chain-linked to the development and use of automation tools trained on other people’s information without their permission. Jobs and livelihoods are at stake. Even whole industries. And so are individual people’s rights and freedoms. Words like “copyright” and “privacy” scare AI developers far more than the claimed existential risks of AGI because these are clever people who haven’tactuallylost touch with reality. But those with a vested interest in scaling AI choose to harp only about the potential upside of their innovations in order to minimize the application of any “guardrails” (to use the minimalist metaphor of choice when technologists are finally forced to apply limits to their tech) standing in the way of achieving greater profits. Toss in geopolitical rivalries and a bleak global economic picture and nation states’ governments can often be all too willing to join the AI hype and fray, pushing for less governance in the hopes it might help them scale their own national AI champions. With such a skewed backdrop, is it any wonder AI governance remains such a horribly confusing and tangled mess? Even in the European Union where, earlier this year, lawmakers did actually adopta risk-based framework for regulating a minority of applications of AI, the loudest voices discussing this landmark effort are still decrying its existence and claiming the law spells doom for the bloc’s chances of homegrown innovation. And they’re doing that even after the law got watered down afterearlier tech industry lobbying(led by France, with its eye on the interests of Mistral, its hope for a national GenAI champion). Vested interests aren’t stopping there, either. We now have Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram —turned Big AI developer— openly lobbying to deregulate European privacy laws to remove limits on how it can use people’s information to train AIs. Will no one rid Meta of this turbulent data protection regulation so it canstrip-mine Europeans of their culture for ad profit? Its latest open letter lobbying against the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was written up in theWSJ, loops in a bunch of other commercial giants also willing to deregulate for profit, including Ericsson, Spotify, and SAP. “Europe has become less competitive and less innovative compared to other regions and it now risks falling further behind in the AI era due to inconsistent regulatory decision making,” the letter reportedly suggests. Meta has a long history of breaking EU privacy law — chalking up amajority of the 10 largest-ever GDPR finesto date, for example, and racking up billions of dollars in fines — so it really shouldn’t be a poster child for lawmaking priorities. Yet, when it comes to AI, here we are! Having broken so many EU laws, we’re apparently supposed to listen to Meta’s ideas for removing the obstacle of having laws to break in the first place? This is the kind of magical thinking AI can provoke. But the really scary thing is there’s a danger lawmakers might inhale this propaganda and hand the levers of power to those who would automate everything — putting blind faith in a headless god of scale in the hopes that AI will automagically deliver economic prosperity for all. It’s a strategy — if we can even call it that — which totally ignores the fact that the last several decades of (very lightly regulated) digital development have delivered the very opposite: a staggering concentration of wealth and power sucked in by a handful of massive platforms — Big Tech. Clearly, platform giants want to repeat the trick with Big AI. But policymakers risk walking mindlessly down the self-serving pathways being recommended to them by its handsomely rewarded army of policy lobbyists. This isn’t remotely close to a fair fight — if it’s even a fight at all. Economic pressures are certainly driving a lot of soul searching in Europe right now. A much anticipatedreportearlier this month by the Italian economist Mario Draghi on the never-so-sensitive topic of the future of European competitiveness itself chafes at self-imposed “regulatory burdens” that are also specifically described as “self-defeating for those in the digital sectors.” Given the timing of Meta’s open letter, it’s surely aiming to hook into the same conclusion. But that’s hardly surprising: Meta and several of the others adding their signatures to this push to deregulate EU privacy laws are among the long list of companies thatDraghi directly consulted for his report. (Meanwhile, asothers have pointed out, the economist’s contributor disclosure list does not include any digital rights or human rights groups, aside from the consumer group BEUC.) The asymmetry of interests driving AI uptake while simultaneously seeking to downgrade and dilute governance efforts makes it hard to see how a genuinely global consensus can emerge on how to control AI’s scale and stupidity. But the UN AI advisory group has a few solid-looking ideas if anyone is willing to listen. The report’s recommendations include setting up an independent international scientific panel to survey AI capabilities, opportunities, risks, and uncertainties and identify areas where more research is needed with a focus on the public interest (albeit, good luck finding academics not already on Big AI’s payroll). Another recommendation is intergovernmental AI dialogues that would take place twice a year on the margins of existing UN meetings to share best practices, exchange info, and push for more international interoperability on governance. The report also mentions an AI standards exchange that would maintain a register of definitions and work to foster standards harmonization internationally. The UN body also suggests creating what it calls an “AI capacity development network” to pool expertise and resources to support the development of AI governance within governments and for the public interest; and also setting up a global fund for AI to tackle digital divides that the unequal distribution of automation technology also risks scaling drastically. On data, the report suggests establishing what it calls a “global AI data framework” to set definitions and principles for governing training data, including with a view to ensuring cultural and linguistic diversity. The effort should establish common standards around the provenance of data and its use — to ensure “transparent and rights-based accountability across jurisdictions.” The UN body also recommends setting up data trusts and other mechanisms that it suggests could help foster AI growth without compromising information stewardship, such as through “well-governed global marketplaces for exchange of anonymized data for training AI models” and via “model agreements” to allow for cross border access to data. A final recommendation is for the UN to establish an AI Office within the Secretariat to act as a coordination body, reporting to the secretary general to provide support, engage in outreach and advise the UN chief. And one thing is clear: AI is going to demand a massive mobilization of effort, organization, and sweating toil if we’re to avoid the vested interests setting the governance agenda.

Phlair’s carbon-sucking technology could lower direct air capture’s costs,Tim De Chant,2024-09-19T03:00:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/phlairs-carbon-sucking-technology-could-lower-direct-air-captures-costs/,Climate,"Comment When it comes to climate change, there’s no such thing as a “get out of jail free” card. But there might be an inexpensive alternative: direct air capture. The technology isn’t exactly an exoneration, but more like community service; it promises to suck massive amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, atoning for our century-plus of transgressive burning of fossil fuels. Scientifically, it’s a sound idea. Commercially, it has been less so. Currently,it costs about $600 to $1,000to capture a metric ton of carbon, which is far more than anyone thinks is commercially viable. So myriad startups are racing to cut costs, aiming to capture one metric ton of carbon dioxide for $100 or less. Even at that price, it could be a difficult sell since burning fossil fuels remains, for the most part, free. But many investors and even a few multinational corporations like Microsoft, Shopify, and Stripe are betting that eventually, the world will embrace direct air capture, much like how we treat wastewater today instead of dumping it into a river. Larger startups like Climeworks and Carbon Engineering are betting that scale will help rein costs in. Both companies use sorbents to draw out the carbon dioxide and use heat to release it from the sorbents so it can be stored elsewhere. Smaller startups suggest that scale alone won’t be enough, though. “Thermal regeneration is always the expensive step, energy wise,” said Malte Feucht, co-founder and CEO ofPhlair, a young direct air capture startup. He may have a point.One studysays that capturing a meaningful amount of carbon, around 10 gigatons per year, using Carbon Engineering’s approach would require nearly three-quarters of all the electricity generated in the world today. Feucht’s company thinks that a different approach that doesn’t rely on heat might help bring costs down. Like most direct air capture companies, Phlair uses fans to blow air over an absorber. But instead of heating the sorbent, it uses an acid to liberate the carbon dioxide. To produce the acid and base used in the process, Phlair, formerly known as Carbon Atlantis, developed a device it calls a hydrolyzer. The hydrolyzer borrows heavily from the hydrogen industry, taking elements from both membrane-based electrolyzers and membrane-based fuel cells, Feucht said. (An electrolyzer makes hydrogen using electricity, whereas a fuel cell consumes hydrogen to produce it.) “Instead of hydrogen, we only produce acids and bases,” he said. Phlair’s DAC machine employs what’s known as the “pH swing” method to capture carbon dioxide. Inside, the basic (high pH) solvent absorbs carbon dioxide as it flows through the air contractor. After the saturated solvent exits the contractor, it is dumped into a tank where it’s doused with acid (low pH). That swing in pH from high to low spurs a chemical reaction that releases the carbon dioxide so it can be piped elsewhere to be used or stored. The solvent then flows back into the hydrolyzer where it’s regenerated. Phlair is deploying a pilot in the next few weeks, Feucht said, that can capture around 10 metric tons of carbon per year. After that, the startup is working on larger, 260-metric-ton plants that are scheduled to come online in late 2025. One being built with Paebbl in the Netherlands will deliver carbon to help make a cement additive, while the other in Canada will be built with Deep Sky, a carbon removal project developer, which will store the carbon. The DAC startup has already sold a number of carbon credits to organizations likeFrontier, which works with Alphabet, Meta, Shopify, Stripe, and others to create an advanced market commitment for direct air capture. To help complete the larger projects, Phlair has raised a €12 million seed round along with a €2.5 million grant from the EU’s EIC Accelerator. Extantia Capital led the investment round with Atlantic Labs, Counteract, Planet A, UnternehmerTUM Funding for Innovators, and Verve Ventures participating. “I think this is a sort of a unique time in history. Ten years ago, you would have probably needed to found an NGO to do what we’re doing,” Feucht said. “Now there’s a real opportunity to serve customers, to build a functioning company, but then also to address that [carbon] problem. For me, that’s my personal, super big motivation.” Powered byWordPress VIP"
India weighs easing market share limits for UPI payment operators,Manish Singh,2024-09-18T23:54:29-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/india-weighs-easing-market-share-limits-for-upi-payment-operators/,Government & Policy,"Comment The governing body overseeing India’s popular UPI payments rail is considering easing its proposed market share cap for operators like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm as itstruggles to enforce limitations, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which reports to India’s central bank, is considering increasing the market share that UPI operators are allowed to hold to more than 40%, the two people said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. The regulator had previously proposed a 30% market share limit to encourage competition in the space. UPI has become the most widely used way people send and receive money in India, and the mechanism processes over 12 billion transactions a month. Walmart-backed PhonePe commands roughly 48% market share by volume and 50% by value, while Google Pay holds a 37.3% share by volume. Paytm, once a heavyweight in the space, has seen its market share drop to 7.2% from 11% at the end of last yearamid regulatory challenges. The NPCI increasing market share limits is likely to be a controversial move, as several UPI providers have been hoping regulators would step in to curb the dominance of PhonePe and Google Pay, according to several industry executives. The NPCI, which has so far declined to comment on the market share issue, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. The regulator had initially planned to enforce the market share limits in January 2021 butpushed back the deadline to January 1, 2025. The regulator hasstruggled to find a feasible wayto enforce its market share limits proposal. The stakes are high, particularly for PhonePe, which is the most valuable fintech startup in India, witha $12 billion valuation. PhonePe’s co-founder and chief executive, Sameer Nigam, last month said that the startup cannot go public “if there is uncertainty on the regulatory side.” “If you are buying a share at Rs 100 and you price it assuming we have 48-49% market share, then there is an uncertainty about whether it will come down to 30% and by when,” Nigam said at a fintech conference last month. “We are requesting them (the regulator) if they can find another way to at least solve whatever their concerns are or tell us what the list of concerns is,” he added.

Palmer Luckey returns to headsets as Anduril partners with Microsoft on U.S. military tech,Connie Loizos,2024-09-18T21:47:57-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/palmer-luckey-back-in-the-headset-biz-as-anduril-partners-with-microsoft-on-u-s-military-system/,Government & Policy,"Comment Palmer Luckey, the Hawaiian-shirt wearing founder who sold Oculus VR for$2 billionbefore co-founding the military tech company Anduril, is back in the headset business — in a sense. Anduril will soon embed its software into theIntegrated Visual Augmentation Systemheadset developed by Microsoft for the U.S. military in 2021. According toWired, the software will be incorporated into the head-mounted displays for training; it could also provide soldiers data about drones, ground vehicles, or aerial defense systems beyond their visual range. “If you have an augmented-reality display that can make you 20 percent more lethal or make someone 10 percent safer, that’s a bigger improvement than just about any piece of gear you could give you,” Luckey tells the outlet. Anduril has been on a roll this year. In May, itlandeda U.S. military contract to build an autonomous fighter jet; last month, it closed onnew fundingat a $14 billion valuation.

CEO of self-driving startup Motional is stepping down,Kirsten Korosec,2024-09-18T19:28:21-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/ceo-of-self-driving-startup-motional-is-stepping-down/,Transportation,"Comment Motional, the autonomous vehicle startup backed by Hyundai, is shaking up its leadership ranks. Karl Iagnemma, an early pioneer in the autonomous vehicle industry whose startupNutonomylies at the foundation of Motional, is stepping down as president and CEO. Iagnemma will move over to a senior strategy adviser role, while CTO Laura Major will become interim CEO, according to acompany announcementthat was released Wednesday evening. Major will also maintain her CTO role. Motional didn’t provide a reason for the change, although one source familiar told TechCrunch the decision was amicable. In a statement, Iagnemma said he was honored to serve as CEO and is “immensely proud of the progress” the team has made toward developing and deploying safe autonomous vehicles. Iagnemma has been a central figure not just at Motional, but also within the autonomous vehicle industry. Iagnemma and Emilio Frazzoli, who became well known in academic circles for their robotics and AV research, were part of the MIT team that participated in DARPA’s autonomous vehicle research and development program called the Urban Challenge in 2007. The pair would go on to found AV startup Nutonomy (stylized as nuTonomy) in 2013. Nutonomy never received the same amount of media attention as other bigger and better funded AV players like the Google self-driving project now known as Waymo. However, it got the attention of investors and the automotive and tech industry when it became the first to deploy a public trial of aself-driving car servicein Singapore in August 2016. A little more than a year later, Nutonomywas acquiredby Delphi — now known as Aptiv — for $450 million. When Hyundai and Aptiv formed a $4 billion joint venture in 2019 called Motional to commercialize autonomous vehicles, Iagnemma took the top leadership role. Motional has made progress on its push to launch a commercial robotaxi. However, it has also faced a challenging funding environment that delayed its plans. Earlier this year, automotive supplier Aptiv — the other half of the joint venture — said it wouldno longer allocate capitaltoward the endeavor. Hyundai ultimately stepped forward and in Mayagreed to investanother $1 billion into Motional. Hyundai made a $475 million direct investment in Motional and spent another $448 million to buy 11% of Aptiv’s common equity interest. The deal gave Hyundai a majority stake, while providing the self-driving startup with the necessary capital to keep operating. But it came with a cost. Motional laid off about 550 people,paused commercial operations, and delayed plans to launch a robotaxi service with its next-gen Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis until 2026 as part of a restructuring. The commercial operations included taxi rides in autonomous Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles in Las Vegas via the Uber and Lyft network. The company also ended deliveries using its autonomous vehicles for Uber Eats customers in Santa Monica. A human safety operator was behind the wheel in all of its commercial operations. The restructuring was designed to make progress on the core technology and the business model while preserving capital, sources familiar with the changes said at the time. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Craig Newmark pledges $100M to fight hacking by foreign governments,Connie Loizos,2024-09-18T18:02:17-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/craig-newmark-pledges-100m-to-fight-hacking-by-foreign-governments/,Security,"Comment Craig Newmark plans to donate $100 million to further strengthen U.S. cybersecurity.

JP Morgan’s head of startup banking says ‘Founder Mode’ won’t get you a unicorn,Kirsten Korosec,2024-09-18T13:35:06-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/podcast/jp-morgans-head-of-startup-banking-says-founder-mode-wont-get-you-a-unicorn/,Startups,"From the Podcast Ashraf Hebela, J.P. Morgan’s Head of Startup Banking, may sit on the finance side of startups these days. But he once sat in the founder seat. It’s been his experience in these two worlds — as a founder and in his decades-long finance career, including a 13-year stint at Silicon Valley Bank — that informs his insights today. Hebela joined theEquitypodcast to discuss his recent Startup Insightsreport, specifically wading through data that reveals the latest early-stage investment trends, emerging sectors, and startup hubs beyond the Bay Area (Austin and Miami are two of them). Taken as a whole, Hebela explained, founders can gain insights on how to build the next unicorn. Of course, to understand the investment landscape today, Hebela and host Kirsten Korosec looked back at 2021, a year in which “ample liquidity” helped spur the highest level of unicorn creation to date. Since then, the rate of unicorn births has declined 88% compared to 21% for first financings. That decline isn’t all bad news, though, Hebela said. “You see some healthy years pre-2021 and some healthy years post 2021,” Hebela said. “Even this year where you hear some folks feeling not so great about the innovation economy environment, it’s still trending towards a $180 billion year with deals trending towards that 15,000, 16,000 deal mark. Those are numbers that are above historical ranges, number one. And they rival the top-five years in the innovation economy historically.” Hebela furthered his point, noting that taking out the 2021 macro factors, we still have great entrepreneurs and the rise of consequential tech like quantum computing, auto tech, space tech, biopharma, life sciences, and climate tech. Hebela is cognizant there are challenges for founders today. “It’s a little bit of a have and have not environment right now,” he said, pointing specifically to the startups with core AI products and those that are not focused on that. “I do think that it’s a different experience depending on the type of company that you’re trying to bring online. There are plenty of successful artificial intelligence companies that are not having a problem raising. In fact, there is so much capital available to them that they’re looking for things like private placements to get to those dollars because they’re raising $300 million or $400 million at a Series C; those were unheard of numbers back in the day.” Regardless of whether AI is at the center of a startup, Hebela said he “would never count the entrepreneurial spirit out in the innovation economy,” later noting growth in areas like fintech, robotics, and clean tech. So how does a founder hit the right mark when seeking funding? Hebela’s recent Startup Insights report points to different traits that investors are looking for today, such as a founder coming from a top-tier university. But Hebela cautioned that it varies and is dependent on the sector and product the startup is building. In other words, you do not need to go to Harvard or Stanford to raise dollars. Technical expertise may matter more in certain sectors like robotics, he noted. “There are multiple vectors in which you can play your hand towards looking attractive,” he said, adding that having a great idea you’re passionate about and being resilient are just as important. And to lean in on one recent discussion, we asked Hebela if leadership style such as “founder mode” matters. Hebela said the “founder mode” column by Paul Graham contained a lot of valuable ideas, but he believes it’s important to focus less on the specifics of founder mode and more on the philosophy of it. “To me that’s resilience and passion and commitment to the idea,” he said, adding how that looks and how that tactically feels from one entrepreneur to another should be different. He cautioned against creating a monolithic set of attributes because that can be exclusionary. “Those attributes can work really, really well for a specific gender or for a specific socioeconomic background, or for specific folks that have been fortunate enough to be part of the “inside crowd,” whether it be the universities or the former successful companies. So I think we need to be welcoming of the fact that those tactics will look different, and that should be a great thing. And that’s why I think, for me, it really comes down to the founders’ values: resilience, enterprising, innovative, [and] the ability to get out there and network to the best of their ability, create circles of trust, create advisorship, build off great ideas that are solving real problems.” He added that he prefers these value-based attributes over culture. “There’s a little bit of some of that stuff where the culture can get a little dangerous and exclusionary,” he said.

"Bluesky addresses trust and safety concerns around abuse, spam, and more",Sarah Perez,2024-09-18T13:29:43-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/bluesky-addresses-trust-and-safety-concerns-around-abuse-spam-and-more/,Social,"Comment Social networking startupBluesky, which is building a decentralized alternative to X (formerly Twitter), offered an update on Wednesday about how it’s approaching various trust and safety concerns on its platform. The company is in various stages of developing and piloting a range of initiatives focused on dealing with bad actors, harassment, spam, fake accounts, video safety, and more. To address malicious users or those who harass others, Bluesky says it’s developing new tooling that will be able to detect when multiple new accounts are spun up and managed by the same person. This could help to cut down on harassment, where a bad actor creates several different personas to target their victims. Another new experiment will help to detect “rude” replies and surface them to server moderators. Similar to Mastodon, Bluesky will support a network where self-hosters and other developers can run their own servers that connect with Bluesky’s server and others on the network. This federation capability isstill in early access. However, further down the road, server moderators will be able to decide how they want to take action on those who post rude replies. Bluesky, meanwhile, will eventually reduce these replies’ visibility in its app. Repeated rude labels on content will also lead to account-level labels and suspensions, it says. To cut down on the use of lists to harass others, Bluesky will remove individual users from a list if they block the list’s creator. Similar functionality was also recently rolled out to Starter Packs, which are a type of sharable list that can help new users find people to follow on the platform (check out theTechCrunch Starter Pack). Bluesky will also scan for lists with abusive names or descriptions to cut down on people’s ability to harass others by adding them to a public list with a toxic or abusive name or description. Those who violate Bluesky’s Community Guidelines will be hidden in the app until the list owner makes changes to comply with Bluesky’s rules. Users who continue to create abusive lists will also have further action taken against them, though the company didn’t offer details, adding that lists are still an area of active discussion and development. In the months ahead, Bluesky will also shift to handling moderation reports through its app using notifications, instead of relying on email reports. To fight spam and other fake accounts, Bluesky is launching a pilot that will attempt to automatically detect when an account is fake, scamming, or spamming users. Paired with moderation, the goal is to be able to take action on accounts within “seconds of receiving a report,” the company said. One of the more interesting developments involves how Bluesky will comply with local laws while still allowing for free speech. It will use geography-specific labels allowing it to hide a piece of content for users in a particular area to comply with the law. “This allows Bluesky’s moderation service to maintain flexibility in creating a space for free expression, while also ensuring legal compliance so that Bluesky may continue to operate as a service in those geographies,” the company shared in a blog post. “This feature will be introduced on a country-by-country basis, and we will aim to inform users about the source of legal requests whenever legally possible.” To address potential trust and safety issues with video, which was recently added, the team is adding features like being able to turn off autoplay for videos, making sure video is labeled, and ensuring that videos can be reported. It’s still evaluating what else may need to be added, something that will be prioritized based on user feedback. When it comes to abuse, the company says that its overall framework is “asking how often something happens vs how harmful it is.” The company focuses on addressing high-harm and high-frequency issues while also “tracking edge cases that could result in serious harm to a few users.” The latter, though only affecting a small number of people, causes enough “continual harm” that Bluesky will take action to prevent the abuse, it claims. User concerns can be raised via reports, emails, and mentions to the@safety.bsky.appaccount. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"Fal.ai, which hosts media-generating AI models, raises $23M from a16z and others",Kyle Wiggers,2024-09-18T13:14:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/fal-ai-which-hosts-media-generating-ai-models-raises-23m-from-a16z-and-others/,Fundraising,"Comment Fal.ai, a dev-focused platform for AI-generated audio, video, and images, today revealed that it’s raised $23 million in funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z),Black Forest Labsco-founder Robin Rombach, and Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas. It’s a two-round deal: $14 million of Fal’s total came from a Series A tranche led by Kindred Ventures; the remaining $9 million is from a previously unannounced, a16z-led seed round. Burkay Gur and Gorkem Yurtseven co-launched Fal (short for “Features and labels”) in 2021. Yurtseven previously worked at Amazon as a software dev, while Gur, an ex-Oracle engineer, led machine learning development at Coinbase for several years. While hacking together side projects during the pandemic, Gur and Yurtseven, longtime friends, realized the growing demand for AI cloud infrastructure — particularly infrastructure to run generative AI models. “The big bet was that the nascent space of generative media was about to change all media consumed,” Gur told TechCrunch. “The timing worked out perfectly, because there were some breakthrough models that were released right after Fal started.” Fal offers two products: privately managed compute and workflows for running models, and APIs for open source models that generate images, audio, and video. Fal was one of the first platforms to host Black Forest Labs’ Flux, the model powering image generation inGrok, X’s controversial chatbot. Many cloud rivals likeCoreWeaveprovide resources along these same lines. But what makes Fal different is its scalability, Gur argues. “Our platform can handle hundreds of millions of requests [and our] own inference engine is the most performant,” he said. “Using Fal, you can integrate models into your applications — the product is for enterprises that have media at the core of what they do.” Whether those claims hold up to scrutiny or not, Fal has managed to grow an impressive customer roster. In addition to Perplexity (which explains Srinivas’ investment) and enterprise customers in the retail and e-commerce sector, popular generative AI apps Photoroom, Freepik, and PlayHT are all paying for Fal’s services, Gur says. It’s a profitable bunch. A source tells TechCrunch that Fal’s annual run rate has climbed to nearly $10 million (~$800,000 per month), up around 10x from January. The Series A valued the startup at $80 million. “Fal has reached 500,000 developers on the platform,” Gur said, “generating 50 million images, videos, or audio streams a day.” Given the many deepfake and misinformation risks around generative technologies, I asked Gur if Fal has moderation policies or filters in place for sensitive content. He said that Fal prefers to take a hands-off approach, leaving the decision whether to implement safety features up to the companies developing models on Fal’s platform. “For moderation, a lot of what is done happens during training, so we leave that to the companies building the models,” Gur said. “As you might guess, having a very robust program requires more research and resources.” It’s a bit of an empty answer, given that Fal sponsors some open source training efforts under its research grants program. One would assume that Fal has a say in the development of models it funds. Gur did suggest, however, that Fal is looking to undertake some de-toxifying efforts itself… at some point. “We do have plans to do more of this in-house, and rely on some vendors specialized in this type of work,” he said. I asked about IP liability, as well. Should the models on Fal’s platform regurgitate any copyrighted data, will the company protect customers if they’re sued? Gur wouldn’t answer. But the language in Fal’sterms of serviceimply that customers are on their own. That’s in contrast to generative AI products from Adobe, Canva, Google, Microsoft, and Shutterstock, all of which have indemnity clauses (albeit withsome carve-outs). Vendors like Getty Images, as well as startups such as Fairly Trained, have gone so far as to train models only on “commercially safe” content to avoid the threat of copyright lawsuits altogether. That’s all to say, those who use Fal assume some risk. Fal intends to spend the bulk of the capital it’s raised so far on upgrading its inference optimization product to make it self-serve. The company is also establishing a research team that’ll focus on model optimizations and will join Fal’s 17-person staff. Fal’s other backers include Vercel founder Guillermo Rauch, entrepreneur and investor Balaji Srinivasan, and Hugging Face CTO Julien Chaumond. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Bill requiring AM radio in new cars gets closer to law,Rebecca Bellan,2024-09-18T13:00:57-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/bill-requiring-am-radio-in-new-cars-gets-closer-to-law/,Transportation,"Comment A House committee overwhelmingly voted to approve a bill that would require new cars to be built with AM radio at no additional cost to the owner. TheAM for Every Vehicle Actwill now head to the House floor for final approval. If successful, it’ll go to the president’s desk to be signed into law, pending a veto. Advocates for the bill have argued the decline of AM radio, a consequence of the software-defined vehicle, could make it difficult to broadcast emergency information, particularly in rural areas. The bill was introduced in May 2023 after automakers, including Ford, Tesla, BMW, and Volkswagen, promised to remove AM radio from new EVs, saying electric engines can interfere with the sound of AM radio stations. Ford reversed its decisionshortly after lawmakers introduced the bill. At the time, Ford told TechCrunch that less than 5% of its customers listened to AM radio. Powered byWordPress VIP"
"HTC takes on Apple’s Vision Pro and PC Gaming with $1,000 Vive Focus Vision",Brian Heater,2024-09-18T11:44:59-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/htc-takes-on-apples-vision-pro-and-pc-gaming-with-1000-vive-focus-vision/,Hardware,"Comment TechCrunch spent some time with the $1,119Vive XR Eliteportable headset that hadMeta’s Quest Profirmly in its sights. The new Vive Focus Vision, which was announced on Wednesday, is a fair bit larger and $1,000 less expensive than that system. The new headset looks to swim in similar waters asApple’s Vision Pro,Microsoft’s HoloLens, and theMagic Leap 2. It’s a mixed reality headset, meaning it offers VR and passthrough-style AR experiences. It’s also mixed use, aiming at both gamers and enterprise firms. Much like Magic Leap, HTC understands that enterprise is where the money is — especially now that Meta’sloss-leading Quest headsetshave come to dominate the casual market. That said, along with its enterprise bona fides, the Vive Focus Vision has enough firepower under the hood to appeal to PC gamers tethered via the DisplayPort. “Vive Focus Vision gives you the best of both worlds, with outstanding standalone capabilities, and DisplayPort mode support for visually lossless PCVR experiences,” says Global Head of Product Shen Ye. “Now, PC gamers can bring the same high-end headsets used in VR arcades into their homes. We’re taking everything to the next level with built-in eye-tracking, stereo color passthrough cameras for depth-correct mixed reality, and even an infra-red sensor for enhanced hand tracking in low-light conditions.” The headset takes a kitchen sink approach to the category. Along with DisplayPort support, it features built-in eye tracking, dual 16-megapixel camera for full color passthrough, depth sensing, and a combined 5K resolution. The display has a 120-degree field of view and can support up to a 120Hz refresh rate. The cooling system has been upgraded — a must for the aforementioned lossless PCVR sessions. There’s also an onboard backup battery that keeps it alive when swapping out the main battery. Preorders open Wednesday. The system should start shipping in mid-October. Powered byWordPress VIP"
Fisker reverses course on making Ocean owners pay for recall repairs,Sean O'Kane,2024-09-18T11:27:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/fisker-reverses-course-on-making-ocean-owners-pay-for-recall-repairs/,Transportation,"Comment Bankrupt EV startup Fisker is reversing course just a few days after telling owners that they would have to pay labor costs for recall repairs. The company edited theFAQpage on its website to say “Fisker will provide the necessary parts (including the labor) at no cost to you.” Fisker originally broke the bad news to thousands of Ocean SUV owners on Sunday night when it published the FAQ. The company said three of the five recalls — one for sudden loss of power, one for incorrectly displayed warning lights, and one for reduction in regenerative breaking — can be resolved with over-the-air software updates at no cost. The other two recalls require parts and labor, though. Some of the Oceans have faulty door handles. And all of the SUVs need an electric water pump replaced, which was causing some vehicles to lose power. Fisker originally told owners that it would cover the cost of the parts, but that they’d have to pay for the inspection and repair process at an authorized service provider. (The company says it will send owners a list of these providers by “the end of September 2024.”) The reversal comes as EV startup Fisker prepares to enter the fourth month of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. Fisker recently reached a settlement plan with its biggest secured lender, the committee of unsecured creditors, contract manufacturer Magna, and other parties involved in the bankruptcy. After a few months of back-and-forth, which occasionally got heated, the parties agreed on how to split up the proceeds of a liquidation of Fisker’s assets. The judge in the case has set a hearing for early October where that settlement plan might be approved. The company already inked a sale ofvirtually all of its remaining vehicle inventoryto New York vehicle leasing company American Lease for up to $46.25 million. Now it has to liquidate its remaining assets — allegedly more than $1 billion worth, largely consisting of manufacturing equipment that was used at Magna’s factory in Austria — in order to pay back its many creditors. Update: This story was originally published on September 16 and was updated on September 18 to reflect Fisker’s pivot. Powered byWordPress VIP"

LinkedIn scraped user data for training before updating its terms of service,Kyle Wiggers,2024-09-18T10:15:40-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/linkedin-scraped-user-data-for-training-before-updating-its-terms-of-service/,AI,"Comment LinkedIn may have trained AI models on user data without updating its terms. LinkedIn users in the U.S. — but not the EU, EEA, or Switzerland, likely due to those regions’ data privacy rules — have an opt-outtogglein their settings screen disclosing that LinkedIn scrapes personal data to train “content creation AI models.” The toggle isn’t new. But, as firstreportedby 404 Media, LinkedIn initially didn’t refresh its privacy policy to reflect the data use. The terms of service have now beenupdated, but ordinarily that occurs well before a big change like using user data for a new purpose like this. The idea is it gives users an option to make account changes or leave the platform if they don’t like the changes. Not this time, it seems. So what models is LinkedIn training? Its own, the companysaysin a Q&A, including models for writing suggestions and post recommendations. But LinkedIn also says that generative AI models on its platform may be trained by “another provider,” like its corporate parent Microsoft. “As with most features on LinkedIn, when you engage with our platform we collect and use (or process) data about your use of the platform, including personal data,” the Q&A reads. “This could include your use of the generative AI (AI models used to create content) or other AI features, your posts and articles, how frequently you use LinkedIn, your language preference, and any feedback you may have provided to our teams. We use this data, consistent with our privacy policy, to improve or develop the LinkedIn services.” LinkedIn previously told TechCrunch that it uses “privacy enhancing techniques, including redacting and removing information, to limit the personal information contained in datasets used for generative AI training.” To opt out of LinkedIn’s data scraping, head to the “Data Privacy” section of the LinkedIn settings menu on desktop, click “Data for Generative AI improvement,” then toggle off the “Use my data for training content creation AI models” option. You can also attempt to opt out more comprehensivelyvia this form, but LinkedIn notes that any opt-out won’t affect training that’s already taken place. The nonprofit Open Rights Group (ORG) has called on the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the U.K.’s independent regulator for data protection rights, to investigate LinkedIn and other social networks that train on user data by default. Earlier this week, Metaannouncedthat it was resuming plans to scrape user data for AI training after working with the ICO to make the opt-out process simpler. “LinkedIn is the latest social media company found to be processing our data without asking for consent,” Mariano delli Santi, ORG’s legal and policy officer, said in a statement. “The opt-out model proves once again to be wholly inadequate to protect our rights: the public cannot be expected to monitor and chase every single online company that decides to use our data to train AI. Opt-in consent isn’t only legally mandated, but a common-sense requirement.” Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), the supervisory authority responsible for monitoring compliance with the GDPR, the EU’s overarching privacy framework, told TechCrunch that LinkedIn informed it last week that clarifications to its global privacy policy would be issued today. “LinkedIn advised us that the policy would include an opt-out setting for its members who did not want their data used for training content generating AI models,” a spokesperson for the DPC said. “This opt-out is not available to EU/EEA members as LinkedIn is not currently using EU/EEA member data to train or fine-tune these models.” TechCrunch has reached out to LinkedIn for comment. We’ll update this piece if we hear back. The demand for more data to train generative AI models has led a growing number of platforms to repurpose or otherwise reuse their vast troves of user-generated content. Some have even moved to monetize this content — Tumblr owner Automattic, Photobucket, Reddit, and Stack Overflow are among the networks licensing data to AI model developers. Not all of them have made it easy to opt out. When Stack Overflowannouncedthat it would begin licensing content, several users deleted their posts in protest —only to see those posts restored and their accounts suspended.

This Week in AI: Why OpenAI’s o1 changes the AI regulation game,Kyle Wiggers,2024-09-18T10:05:00-07:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/this-week-in-ai-why-openais-o1-changes-the-ai-regulation-game/,AI,"Comment Hiya, folks, welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign uphere. It’s been just a few days since OpenAI revealed its latest flagshipgenerative model, o1, to the world. Marketed as a “reasoning” model, o1 essentially takes longer to “think” about questions before answering them, breaking down problems and checking its own answers. There’s a great many things o1can’t do well— and OpenAI itself admits this. But on some tasks, like physics and math, o1 excels despite not necessarily having more parameters than OpenAI’s previous top-performing model, GPT-4o. (In AI and machine learning, “parameters,” usually in the billions, roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills.) And this has implications for AI regulation. California’s proposed bill SB 1047, for example, imposes safety requirements on AI models that either cost over $100 million to develop or were trained using compute power beyond a certain threshold. Models like o1, however, demonstrate that scaling up training compute isn’t the only way to improve a model’s performance. In aposton X, Nvidia research manager Jim Fan posited that future AI systems may rely on small, easier-to-train “reasoning cores” as opposed to the training-intensive architectures (e.g., Meta’s Llama 405B) that’ve been the trend lately. Recent academic studies, he notes, have shown that small models like o1 can greatly outperform large models given more time to noodle on questions. So was it short-sighted for policymakers to tie AI regulatory measures to compute? Yes, says Sara Hooker, head of AI startup Cohere’s research lab, in an interview with TechCrunch:  [o1] kind of points out how incomplete a viewpoint this is, using model size as a proxy for risk. It doesn’t take into account everything you can do with inference or running a model. For me, it’s a combination of bad science combined with policies that put the emphasis on not the current risks that we see in the world now, but on future risks. Now, does that mean legislators should rip AI bills up from their foundations and start over? No. Many were written to be easily amendable, under the assumption that AI would evolve far beyond their enactment. California’s bill, for instance, would give the state’s Government Operations Agency the authority to redefine the compute thresholds that trigger the law’s safety requirements. The admittedly tricky part will be figuring out which metriccould bea better proxy for risk than training compute. Like so many other aspects of AI regulation, it’s something to ponder as bills around the U.S. — and world — march toward passage. First reactions to o1:Max got initial impressions from AI researchers, startup founders, and VCs on o1 — and tested the model himself. Altman departs safety committee:OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped down from the startup’s committee responsible for reviewing the safety of models such as o1, likely in response to concerns that he wouldn’t act impartially. Slack turns into an agent hub:At its parent company Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference, Slack announced new features, including AI-generated meeting summaries and integrations with tools for image generation and AI-driven web searches. Google begins flagging AI images:Google says that it plans to roll out changes to Google Search to make clearer which images in results were AI generated — or edited by AI tools. Mistral launches a free tier:French AI startup Mistral launched a new free tier to let developers fine-tune and build test apps with the startup’s AI models. Snap launches a video generator:At its annual Snap Partner Summit on Tuesday, Snapchat announced that it’s introducing a new AI video-generation tool for creators. The tool will allow select creators to generate AI videos from text prompts and, soon, from image prompts. Intel inks major chip deal:Intel says it will co-develop an AI chip with AWS using Intel’s 18A chip fabrication process. The companies described the deal as a “multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework” that could potentially involve additional chip designs. Oprah’s AI special:Oprah Winfrey aired a special on AI with guests such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, tech influencer Marques Brownlee, and current FBI director Christopher Wray. We know that AI can be persuasive, but can it dig out someone deep in a conspiracy rabbit hole? Well, not all by itself. Buta new model from Costello et al. at MIT and Cornellcan make a dent in beliefs about untrue conspiracies that persists for at least a couple months. In the experiment, they had people who believed in conspiracy-related statements (e.g., “9/11 was an inside job”) talk with a chatbot that gently, patiently, and endlessly offered counterevidence to their arguments. These conversations led the humans involved to stating a 20% reduction in the associated belief two months later, at least as far as these things can be measured. Here’s an example of one of the conversations in progress: It’s unlikely that those deep into reptilians and deep state conspiracies are likely to consult or believe an AI like this, but the approach could be more effective if it were used at a critical juncture like a person’s first foray into these theories. For instance, if a teenager searches for “Can jet fuel melt steel beams?” they may be experience a learning moment instead of a tragic one. It’s not a model, but it has to do with models: Researchers at Microsoft this weekpublishedan AI benchmark called Eureka aimed at (in their words) “scaling up [model] evaluations … in an open and transparent manner.” AI benchmarks are a dime a dozen. So what makes Eureka different? Well, the researchers say that, for Eureka — which is actually a collection of existing benchmarks — they chose tasks that remain challenging for “even the most capable models.” Specifically, Eureka tests for capabilities often overlooked in AI benchmarks, like visual-spatial navigation skills. To show just how difficult Eureka can be for models, the researchers tested systems, including Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Meta’s Llama, on the benchmark. No single model scored well across all of Eureka’s tests, which the researchers say underscores the importance of “continued innovation” and “targeted improvements” to models. In a win for professional actors, California passed two laws, AB 2602 and AB 1836, restricting the use of AI digital replicas. The legislation, which was backed by SAG-AFTRA, the performers’ union, requires that companies relying on a performer’s digital replica (e.g., cloned voice or image) give a “reasonably specific” description of the replica’s intended use and negotiate with the performer’s legal counsel or labor union. It also requires that entertainment employers gain the consent of a deceased performer’s estate before using a digital replica of that person. As the Hollywood Reporternotesin its coverage, the bills codify concepts that SAG-AFTRA fought for in its 118-day strike last year with studios and major streaming platforms. California is the second state after Tennessee to impose restrictions on the use of digital actor likenesses; SAG-AFTRA also sponsored the Tennessee effort. Powered byWordPress VIP"
